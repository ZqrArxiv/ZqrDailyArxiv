In this work, we aim to reduce data\ncollection efforts when learning visuomotor robot policies by leveraging\nexisting or cost-effective data from a wide range of embodiments, such as\npublic robot datasets and the datasets of humans playing with objects (human\ndata from play). Our approach leverages two key insights. First, we use optic\nflow as an embodiment-agnostic action representation to train a World Model\n(WM) across multi-embodiment datasets, and finetune it on a small amount of\nrobot data from the target embodiment. Second, we develop a method, Latent\nPolicy Steering (LPS), to improve the output of a behavior-cloned policy by\nsearching in the latent space of the WM for better action sequences. In real\nworld experiments, we observe significant improvements in the performance of\npolicies trained with a small amount of data (over 50% relative improvement\nwith 30 demonstrations and over 20% relative improvement with 50\ndemonstrations) by combining the policy with a WM pretrained on two thousand\nepisodes sampled from the existing Open X-embodiment dataset across different\nrobots or a cost-effective human dataset from play.\n","authors":["Yiqi Wang","Mrinal Verghese","Jeff Schneider"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13340v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12440v2","updated":"2025-07-17T17:30:47Z","published":"2025-07-16T17:27:44Z","title":"EgoVLA: Learning Vision-Language-Action Models from Egocentric Human\n  Videos","summary":"  Real robot data collection for imitation learning has led to significant\nadvancements in robotic manipulation.

Traditional\nflow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions\n(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like\ncross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating\ntime and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent\nimages as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action\nwhile eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative\nmodeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different\nmodalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data\nlacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional\nvisual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a\nstructured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,\nup-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we\nsupervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs\nthrough flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss\nthrough sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end\nlearning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging\nbi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and\n2 real-world tasks. Despite its simplicity, MLP-only VITA outperforms or\nmatches state-of-the-art generative policies while reducing inference latency\nby 50-130% compared to conventional flow matching policies requiring different\nconditioning mechanisms or complex architectures.

It improves performance over alternative\nmethods, such as approximate explicit MPC and automatic cost parameter tuning,\nin particular in terms of i) optimizing the long term objective; ii)\nmaintaining computational costs comparable to a short-horizon MPC; iii)\nensuring constraint satisfaction; and iv) generalizing control behaviour to\nenvironments not observed during training. For this purpose, ZipMPC leverages\nthe concept of differentiable MPC with neural networks to propagate gradients\nof the imitation loss through the MPC optimization.

This paper studies the problem of Long-term Active Embodied\nQuestion Answering (LA-EQA), a new task in which a robot must both recall past\nexperiences and actively explore its environment to answer complex,\ntemporally-grounded questions. Unlike traditional EQA settings, which typically\nfocus either on understanding the present environment alone or on recalling a\nsingle past observation, LA-EQA challenges an agent to reason over past,\npresent, and possible future states, deciding when to explore, when to consult\nits memory, and when to stop gathering observations and provide a final answer.\nStandard EQA approaches based on large models struggle in this setting due to\nlimited context windows, absence of persistent memory, and an inability to\ncombine memory recall with active exploration. To address this, we propose a\nstructured memory system for robots, inspired by the mind palace method from\ncognitive science. Our method encodes episodic experiences as scene-graph-based\nworld instances, forming a reasoning and planning algorithm that enables\ntargeted memory retrieval and guided navigation. To balance the\nexploration-recall trade-off, we introduce value-of-information-based stopping\ncriteria that determines when the agent has gathered sufficient information.

Specifically, our model obtains\ncontextual relationships between data features and the target indicator,\ncategorizing their correlations as positive, negative, mixed, or irrelevant.\nThese features are then fed into the linear estimator with tailored weight\nconstraints for each category. To capture nonlinear patterns, the model also\nidentifies meaningful feature interactions and integrates them, along with\nnonlinear transformations. Experiments across three countries at different\nstages of development demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines in\nestimating socio-economic indicators, even for low-income countries with\nlimited data availability.\n","authors":["Kyeongjin Ahn","Sungwon Han","Seungeon Lee","Donghyun Ahn","Hyoshin Kim","Jungwon Kim","Jihee Kim","Sangyoon Park","Meeyoung Cha"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13323v1.pdf","comment":"15 pages, 13 figures, 7 tables"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17703v2","updated":"2025-07-17T17:36:34Z","published":"2025-04-24T16:10:29Z","title":"Federated Learning: A Survey on Privacy-Preserving Collaborative\n  Intelligence","summary":"  Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative paradigm in the field\nof distributed machine learning, enabling multiple clients such as mobile\ndevices, edge nodes, or organizations to collaboratively train a shared global\nmodel without the need to centralize sensitive data.

Assessment of WMH is important in\nresearch and clinics. However, WMH are challenging to segment due to their high\nvariability in shape, location, size, poorly defined borders, and similar\nintensity profile to other pathologies (e.g stroke lesions) and artefacts (e.g\nhead motion). In this work, we assess the utility and semantic properties of\nthe most effective techniques for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in\nsegmentation for the WMH segmentation task across multiple test-time data\ndistributions. We find UQ techniques reduce 'silent failure' by identifying in\nUQ maps small WMH clusters in the deep white matter that are unsegmented by the\nmodel. A combination of Stochastic Segmentation Networks with Deep Ensembles\nalso yields the highest Dice and lowest Absolute Volume Difference % (AVD)\nscore and can highlight areas where there is ambiguity between WMH and stroke\nlesions.

However, these gains often persist\neven when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted\nrewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true\nreasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific\npatterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective\nand identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First,\n\\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test\nproblems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \\emph{evaluation\nfragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are\nhighly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning\nconsistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic\nevaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting\nfixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve\nmultiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across\nstructurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and\nimproving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular\nbenchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and\nVAR-AIME24.

In parallel, recent work on\nGradient Descent (GD) has found a phenomenon called Edge of Stability (EoS), in\nwhich the largest eigenvalue of the NTK oscillates around a value inversely\nproportional to the step size. However, although follow-up works have explored\nthe underlying mechanism of such eigenvalue behavior in depth, the\nunderstanding of the behavior of the NTK eigenvectors during EoS is still\nmissing. This paper examines the dynamics of NTK eigenvectors during EoS in\ndetail.

Many\nprevious works have attempted to provide the theoretical understanding\nunderlying the success of contrastive learning. Almost all of them rely on a\ndefault assumption, i.e., the label consistency assumption, which may not hold\nin practice (the probability of failure is called labeling error) due to the\nstrength and randomness of common augmentation strategies, such as random\nresized crop (RRC). This paper investigates the theoretical impact of labeling\nerror on the downstream classification performance of contrastive learning. We\nfirst reveal several significant negative impacts of labeling error on\ndownstream classification risk. To mitigate these impacts, data dimensionality\nreduction method (e.g., singular value decomposition, SVD) is applied on\noriginal data to reduce false positive samples, and establish both theoretical\nand empirical evaluations. Moreover, it is also found that SVD acts as a\ndouble-edged sword, which may lead to the deterioration of downstream\nclassification accuracy due to the reduced connectivity of the augmentation\ngraph. Based on the above observations, we give the augmentation suggestion\nthat we should use some moderate embedding dimension (such as $512, 1024$ in\nour experiments), data inflation, weak augmentation, and SVD to ensure large\ngraph connectivity and small labeling error to improve model performance.\n","authors":["Jun Chen","Hong Chen","Yonghua Yu","Yiming Ying"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.11161v2.pdf","comment":"Published as ICML2025 poster.

To fix this problem, we propose a\nMulti-View Pruning(MVP), a graph pruning method based on a multi-view framework\nand reconstruction loss. Given a graph, MVP first constructs multiple graphs\nfor different views either by utilizing the predefined modalities or by\nrandomly partitioning the input features, to consider the importance of each\nnode in diverse perspectives. Then, it learns the score for each node by\nconsidering both the reconstruction and the task loss. MVP can be incorporated\nwith any hierarchical pooling framework to score the nodes. We validate MVP on\nmultiple benchmark datasets by coupling it with two graph pooling methods, and\nshow that it significantly improves the performance of the base graph pooling\nmethod, outperforming all baselines. Further analysis shows that both the\nencoding of multiple views and the consideration of reconstruction loss are the\nkey to the success of MVP, and that it indeed identifies nodes that are less\nimportant according to domain knowledge.\n","authors":["Hanjin Kim","Jiseong Park","Seojin Kim","Jueun Choi","Doheon Lee","Sung Ju Hwang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11737v4.pdf","comment":"Jiseong Park and Hanjin Kim are co-first author for this work"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02946v6","updated":"2025-07-17T01:19:42Z","published":"2024-08-06T04:14:29Z","title":"Scaling Trends for Data Poisoning in LLMs","summary":"  LLMs produce harmful and undesirable behavior when trained on datasets\ncontaining even a small fraction of poisoned data.

To generate data via a flow matching model, an\nordinary differential equation (ODE) is numerically solved via forward\nintegration of the modeled velocity field.

Traditional\nflow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions\n(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like\ncross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating\ntime and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent\nimages as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action\nwhile eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative\nmodeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different\nmodalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data\nlacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional\nvisual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a\nstructured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,\nup-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we\nsupervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs\nthrough flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss\nthrough sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end\nlearning.

The solution lies in effectively constructing the spectral-spatial\njoint distribution conditioned on the RGB image to complement the unobservable\nfeature. Since HSIs share a similar spatial structure with the corresponding\nRGB images, it is rational to capitalize on the rich spatial knowledge in RGB\npre-trained models for spectral-spatial joint distribution learning. To this\nend, we extend the RGB pre-trained latent diffusion model (RGB-LDM) to an\nunobservable feature LDM (ULDM) for SR. As the RGB-LDM and its corresponding\nspatial autoencoder (SpaAE) already excel in spatial knowledge, the ULDM can\nfocus on modeling spectral structure.

To\naddress these challenges, we propose FantasyPortrait, a diffusion transformer\nbased framework capable of generating high-fidelity and emotion-rich animations\nfor both single- and multi-character scenarios. Our method introduces an\nexpression-augmented learning strategy that utilizes implicit representations\nto capture identity-agnostic facial dynamics, enhancing the model's ability to\nrender fine-grained emotions.

Defined by oxygen dependence at 36 weeks\npostmenstrual age, it causes lifelong respiratory complications. However,\npreventive interventions carry severe risks, including neurodevelopmental\nimpairment, ventilator-induced lung injury, and systemic complications.\nTherefore, early BPD prognosis and prediction of BPD outcome is crucial to\navoid unnecessary toxicity in low risk infants. Admission radiographs of\nextremely preterm infants are routinely acquired within 24h of life and could\nserve as a non-invasive prognostic tool. In this work, we developed and\ninvestigated a deep learning approach using chest X-rays from 163 extremely\nlow-birth-weight infants ($\\leq$32 weeks gestation, 401-999g) obtained within\n24 hours of birth.

In this work, we present a new notion of\ntask-agnostic action paradigm that decouples action execution from\ntask-specific conditioning, enhancing scalability, efficiency, and\ncost-effectiveness. To address the data collection challenges posed by this\nparadigm -- such as low coverage density, behavioral redundancy, and safety\nrisks -- we introduce ATARA (Automated Task-Agnostic Random Actions), a\nscalable self-supervised framework that accelerates collection by over $\n30\\times $ compared to human teleoperation. To further enable effective\nlearning from task-agnostic data, which often suffers from distribution\nmismatch and irrelevant trajectories, we propose AnyPos, an inverse dynamics\nmodel equipped with Arm-Decoupled Estimation and a Direction-Aware Decoder\n(DAD). We additionally integrate a video-conditioned action validation module\nto verify the feasibility of learned policies across diverse manipulation\ntasks. Extensive experiments show that the AnyPos-ATARA pipeline yields a 51%\nimprovement in test accuracy and achieves 30-40% higher success rates in\ndownstream tasks such as lifting, pick-and-place, and clicking, using\nreplay-based video validation.

To learn\ngolden noises for diffusion sampling, we mainly make three contributions in\nthis paper. First, we identify a new concept termed the \\textit{noise prompt},\nwhich aims at turning a random Gaussian noise into a golden noise by adding a\nsmall desirable perturbation derived from the text prompt.

Second, we design a noise prompt data collection pipeline\nand collect a large-scale \\textit{noise prompt dataset}~(NPD) that contains\n100k pairs of random noises and golden noises with the associated text prompts.\nWith the prepared NPD as the training dataset, we trained a small \\textit{noise\nprompt network}~(NPNet) that can directly learn to transform a random noise\ninto a golden noise.

In this paper, we propose a Dual-Vision Adaptation\n(DVA) approach for FGIR, which guides the frozen pre-trained model to perform\nFGIR through collaborative sample and feature adaptation.

While\nneural parametric models are actively studied for humans and animals, plant\nleaves present unique challenges due to their diverse shapes and flexible\ndeformation. To this problem, we introduce a neural parametric model for\nleaves, NeuraLeaf. Capitalizing on the fact that flattened leaf shapes can be\napproximated as a 2D plane, NeuraLeaf disentangles the leaves' geometry into\ntheir 2D base shapes and 3D deformations. This representation allows learning\nfrom rich sources of 2D leaf image datasets for the base shapes, and also has\nthe advantage of simultaneously learning textures aligned with the geometry. To\nmodel the 3D deformation, we propose a novel skeleton-free skinning model and\ncreate a newly captured 3D leaf dataset called DeformLeaf.

In such cases, NN generalization can be reduced to a problem\nof learning more domain-invariant features. Domain adaptation (DA) methods\ninclude a range of techniques aimed at achieving this; however, these methods\nhave struggled with the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning, which then\nincurs significant computational costs. In this work, we introduce SIDDA, an\nout-of-the-box DA training algorithm built upon the Sinkhorn divergence, that\ncan achieve effective domain alignment with minimal hyperparameter tuning and\ncomputational overhead. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on multiple\nsimulated and real datasets of varying complexity, including simple shapes,\nhandwritten digits, and real astronomical observations. SIDDA is compatible\nwith a variety of NN architectures, and it works particularly well in improving\nclassification accuracy and model calibration when paired with equivariant\nneural networks (ENNs). We find that SIDDA enhances the generalization\ncapabilities of NNs, achieving up to a $\\approx40\\%$ improvement in\nclassification accuracy on unlabeled target data. We also study the efficacy of\nDA on ENNs with respect to the varying group orders of the dihedral group\n$D_N$, and find that the model performance improves as the degree of\nequivariance increases. Finally, we find that SIDDA enhances model calibration\non both source and target data--achieving over an order of magnitude\nimprovement in the ECE and Brier score.

The current state-of-the-art BO approach for permutation\nspaces relies on the Mallows kernel-an $\\Omega(n^2)$ representation that\nexplicitly enumerates every pairwise comparison. Inspired by the close\nrelationship between the Mallows kernel and pairwise comparison, we propose a\nnovel framework for generating kernel functions on permutation space based on\nsorting algorithms. Within this framework, the Mallows kernel can be viewed as\na special instance derived from bubble sort. Further, we introduce the\n\\textbf{Merge Kernel} constructed from merge sort, which replaces the quadratic\ncomplexity with $\\Theta(n\\log n)$ to achieve the lowest possible complexity.\nThe resulting feature vector is significantly shorter, can be computed in\nlinearithmic time, yet still efficiently captures meaningful permutation\ndistances. To boost robustness and right-invariance without sacrificing\ncompactness, we further incorporate three lightweight, task-agnostic\ndescriptors: (1) a shift histogram, which aggregates absolute element\ndisplacements and supplies a global misplacement signal; (2) a split-pair line,\nwhich encodes selected long-range comparisons by aligning elements across the\ntwo halves of the whole permutation; and (3) sliding-window motifs, which\nsummarize local order patterns that influence near-neighbor objectives.

Traditional\nflow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions\n(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like\ncross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating\ntime and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent\nimages as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action\nwhile eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative\nmodeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different\nmodalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data\nlacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional\nvisual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a\nstructured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,\nup-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes.

At the same time, Generative AI -- particularly Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GANs) -- have achieved remarkable success across a wide\nrange of domains, such as healthcare, security, and Image Generation. However,\ntraining generative models typically requires large datasets and significant\ncomputational resources, which are often unavailable in real-world settings.\nAcquiring such resources can be costly and inefficient, especially when many\nunderutilized devices -- such as IoT devices and edge devices -- with varying\ncapabilities remain idle. Moreover, obtaining large datasets is challenging due\nto privacy concerns and copyright restrictions, as most devices are unwilling\nto share their data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach\nfor decentralized GAN training that enables the utilization of distributed data\nand underutilized, low-capability devices while not sharing data in its raw\nform. Our approach is designed to tackle key challenges in decentralized\nenvironments, combining KLD-weighted Clustered Federated Learning to address\nthe issues of data heterogeneity and multi-domain datasets, with Heterogeneous\nU-Shaped split learning to tackle the challenge of device heterogeneity under\nstrict data sharing constraints -- ensuring that no labels or raw data, whether\nreal or synthetic, are ever shared between nodes.

In this paper, we propose a\nDMQ which combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise\nPower-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to effectively address these challenges. Learned\nEquivalent Scaling optimizes channel-wise scaling factors to redistribute\nquantization difficulty between weights and activations, reducing overall\nquantization error. Recognizing that early denoising steps, despite having\nsmall quantization errors, crucially impact the final output due to error\naccumulation, we incorporate an adaptive timestep weighting scheme to\nprioritize these critical steps during learning. Furthermore, identifying that\nlayers such as skip connections exhibit high inter-channel variance, we\nintroduce channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations. To ensure robust\nselection of PTS factors even with small calibration set, we introduce a voting\nalgorithm that enhances reliability.

However, these gains often persist\neven when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted\nrewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true\nreasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific\npatterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective\nand identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First,\n\\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test\nproblems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \\emph{evaluation\nfragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are\nhighly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning\nconsistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic\nevaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting\nfixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve\nmultiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across\nstructurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and\nimproving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular\nbenchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and\nVAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for\nRL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models,\nwith average declines of 48.0\\% on AMC23 and 58.3\\% on AIME24. These findings\nsuggest that many existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail\nto generalize beyond specific numerical forms. Overall, VAR-MATH offers a\nprincipled, contamination-resistant evaluation paradigm for mathematical\nreasoning.\n","authors":["Jian Yao","Ran Cheng","Kay Chen Tan"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.12885v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04502v2","updated":"2025-07-17T08:06:22Z","published":"2025-03-06T14:50:29Z","title":"Interpretable Transformation and Analysis of Timelines through Learning\n  via Surprisability","summary":"  The analysis of high-dimensional timeline data and the identification of\noutliers and anomalies is critical across diverse domains, including sensor\nreadings, biological and medical data, historical records, and global\nstatistics. However, conventional analysis techniques often struggle with\nchallenges such as high dimensionality, complex distributions, and sparsity.\nThese limitations hinder the ability to extract meaningful insights from\ncomplex temporal datasets, making it difficult to identify trending features,\noutliers, and anomalies effectively. Inspired by surprisability -- a cognitive\nscience concept describing how humans instinctively focus on unexpected\ndeviations - we propose Learning via Surprisability (LvS), a novel approach for\ntransforming high-dimensional timeline data. LvS quantifies and prioritizes\nanomalies in time-series data by formalizing deviations from expected behavior.\nLvS bridges cognitive theories of attention with computational methods,\nenabling the detection of anomalies and shifts in a way that preserves critical\ncontext, offering a new lens for interpreting complex datasets. We demonstrate\nthe usefulness of LvS on three high-dimensional timeline use cases: a time\nseries of sensor data, a global dataset of mortality causes over multiple\nyears, and a textual corpus containing over two centuries of State of the Union\nAddresses by U.S. presidents. Our results show that the LvS transformation\nenables efficient and interpretable identification of outliers, anomalies, and\nthe most variable features along the timeline.\n","authors":["Osnat Mokryn","Teddy Lazebnik","Hagit Ben Shoshan"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04502v2.pdf","comment":"Accepted for Publication in Chaos, May 2025"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21773v2","updated":"2025-07-17T08:03:43Z","published":"2025-04-30T16:17:53Z","title":"MAC-Tuning: LLM Multi-Compositional Problem Reasoning with Enhanced\n  Knowledge Boundary Awareness","summary":"  With the widespread application of large language models (LLMs), the issue of\ngenerating non-existing facts, known as hallucination, has garnered increasing\nattention.

While recent\nLLM-powered guardrail approaches such as LlamaGuard achieve high detection\naccuracy of unsafe inputs written in English (e.g., ``How to create a bomb?''),\nthey struggle with multilingual unsafe inputs. This limitation leaves LLM\nsystems vulnerable to unsafe and jailbreak prompts written in low-resource\nlanguages such as those in Southeast Asia. This paper introduces SEALGuard, a\nmultilingual guardrail designed to improve the safety alignment across diverse\nlanguages. It aims to address the multilingual safety alignment gap of existing\nguardrails and ensure effective filtering of unsafe and jailbreak prompts in\nLLM-powered systems. We adapt a general-purpose multilingual language model\ninto a multilingual guardrail using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). We construct\nSEALSBench, a large-scale multilingual safety alignment dataset containing over\n260,000 prompts in ten languages, including safe, unsafe, and jailbreak cases.\nWe evaluate SEALGuard against state-of-the-art guardrails such as LlamaGuard on\nthis benchmark.

In\ncontrast, SEALGuard outperforms existing guardrails in detecting multilingual\nunsafe and jailbreak prompts, improving DSR by 48% over LlamaGuard and\nachieving the best DSR, precision, and F1-score.

The core idea of GMC is to leverage semantically\nquantized discrete item identifiers as a medium for integrating multi-domain\nknowledge within a unified generative model. GMC first employs an item\ntokenizer to generate domain-shared semantic identifiers for each item, and\nthen formulates item recommendation as a next-token generation task by training\na domain-unified sequence-to-sequence model. To further leverage the domain\ninformation to enhance performance, we incorporate a domain-aware contrastive\nloss into the semantic identifier learning, and perform domain-specific\nfine-tuning on the unified recommender.

Making these decisions reliant on human\njudgement is both counter-productive to the aim of exploring very large number\nof scenarios in a timely manner and infeasible when considering the workload\nneeded to involve humans in each of these choices. In this paper, we move human\njudgement outside the simulation decision cycle. Basically, the human will\ndesign the ethical metric space, leaving it to the simulated environment to\nexplore the space. When the simulation completes its testing cycles, the\ntesting environment will come back to the human commander with a few options to\nselect from. The human commander will then exercise human-judgement to select\nthe most appropriate course of action, which will then get executed\naccordingly. We assume that the problem of designing metrics that are\nsufficiently granular to assess the ethical implications of decisions is\nsolved. Subsequently, the fundamental problem we look at in this paper is how\nto weight ethical decisions during the running of these simulations; that is,\nhow to dynamically weight the ethical attributes when agents are faced with\ndecision options with ethical implications during generative simulations.

This paper studies the problem of Long-term Active Embodied\nQuestion Answering (LA-EQA), a new task in which a robot must both recall past\nexperiences and actively explore its environment to answer complex,\ntemporally-grounded questions. Unlike traditional EQA settings, which typically\nfocus either on understanding the present environment alone or on recalling a\nsingle past observation, LA-EQA challenges an agent to reason over past,\npresent, and possible future states, deciding when to explore, when to consult\nits memory, and when to stop gathering observations and provide a final answer.\nStandard EQA approaches based on large models struggle in this setting due to\nlimited context windows, absence of persistent memory, and an inability to\ncombine memory recall with active exploration.

As consensus on\ninternational governance continues to be established and put into action, the\npractical importance of conducting a global assessment of the state of AI\ngovernance is progressively coming to light. In this context, we initiated the\ndevelopment of the AI Governance InternationaL Evaluation Index (AGILE Index).\nAdhering to the design principle, \"the level of governance should match the\nlevel of development,\" the inaugural evaluation of the AGILE Index commences\nwith an exploration of four foundational pillars: the development level of AI,\nthe AI governance environment, the AI governance instruments, and the AI\ngovernance effectiveness.

However, current understanding and evaluation of world models in\nartificial intelligence (AI) remains narrow, often focusing on static\nrepresentations learned from training on a massive corpora of data, instead of\nthe efficiency and efficacy of models in learning these representations through\ninteraction and exploration within a novel environment. In this Perspective, we\nprovide a view of world model induction drawing on decades of research in\ncognitive science on how humans learn and adapt so efficiently; we then call\nfor a new evaluation framework for assessing adaptive world models in AI.\nConcretely, we propose a new benchmarking paradigm based on suites of carefully\ndesigned games with genuine, deep and continually refreshing novelty in the\nunderlying game structures -- we refer to this kind of games as novel games. We\ndetail key desiderata for constructing these games and propose appropriate\nmetrics to explicitly challenge and evaluate the agent's ability for rapid\nworld model induction.

The key idea of the\nproposed method is to encode the complete point cloud, which contains both\ngeometric and material information, into a pair of BEV images (i.e., a spatial\nBEV image and an intensity BEV image). An end-to-end multi-BEV fusion network\nis designed to extract uniform features, equipping UniLGL with spatial and\nmaterial uniformity. To ensure robust LGL across heterogeneous LiDAR sensors, a\nviewpoint invariance hypothesis is introduced, which replaces the conventional\ntranslation equivariance assumption commonly used in existing LPR networks and\nsupervises UniLGL to achieve sensor-type uniformity in both global descriptors\nand local feature representations. Finally, based on the mapping between local\nfeatures on the 2D BEV image and the point cloud, a robust global pose\nestimator is derived that determines the global minimum of the global pose on\nSE(3) without requiring additional registration.

Recent advances in\nlarge-scale models have led to benchmark solutions such as GraspNet-1Billion.\nHowever, such learning-based approaches still face a critical limitation in\nperformance robustness for their sensitivity to sensing noise and environmental\nchanges. To address this bottleneck in achieving highly generalized grasping,\nwe abandon the traditional learning framework and introduce a new perspective:\nsimilarity matching, where similar known objects are utilized to guide the\ngrasping of unknown target objects. We newly propose a method that robustly\nachieves unknown-object grasping from a single viewpoint through three key\nsteps: 1) Leverage the visual features of the observed object to perform\nsimilarity matching with an existing database containing various object models,\nidentifying potential candidates with high similarity; 2) Use the candidate\nmodels with pre-existing grasping knowledge to plan imitative grasps for the\nunknown target object; 3) Optimize the grasp quality through a local\nfine-tuning process. To address the uncertainty caused by partial and noisy\nobservation, we propose a multi-level similarity matching framework that\nintegrates semantic, geometric, and dimensional features for comprehensive\nevaluation.

It is especially challenging in poor lighting and with fast\nmotion. This is partly due to limitations of RGB cameras: To capture frames\nunder low lighting, the exposure time needs to be increased, which leads to\nmore motion blur. In contrast, event cameras, which record changes in pixel\nbrightness asynchronously, are much less dependent on lighting, making them\nmore suitable for recording fast motion. We hence propose the first method to\nspatiotemporally reconstruct a scene from sparse multi-view event streams and\nsparse RGB frames. We train a sequence of cross-faded time-conditioned NeRF\nmodels, one per short recording segment. The individual segments are supervised\nwith a set of event- and RGB-based losses and sparse-view regularisation.

To support the creation of high-quality large-scale video\ncontent, a modern pipeline requires a comprehensive understanding of both the\nraw input materials (e.g., the unedited footage captured by cameras) and the\nediting components (e.g., visual effects). In video editing scenarios, models\nmust process multiple modalities (e.g., vision, audio, text) with strong\nbackground knowledge and handle flexible input lengths (e.g., hour-long raw\nvideos), which poses significant challenges for traditional models. In this\nreport, we introduce Vidi, a family of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for a\nwide range of video understand editing scenarios. The first release focuses on\ntemporal retrieval, i.e., identifying the time ranges within the input videos\ncorresponding to a given text query, which plays a critical role in intelligent\nediting. The model is capable of processing hour-long videos with strong\ntemporal understanding capability, e.g., retrieve time ranges for certain\nqueries. To support a comprehensive evaluation in real-world scenarios, we also\npresent the VUE-TR benchmark, which introduces five key advancements. 1) Video\nduration: significantly longer than videos of existing temporal retrival\ndatasets, 2) Audio support: includes audio-based queries, 3) Query format:\ndiverse query lengths/formats, 4) Annotation quality: ground-truth time ranges\nare manually annotated. 5) Evaluation metric: a refined IoU metric to support\nevaluation over multiple time ranges.

In this study, an innovative imaging omics\nframework was introduced, combining retinal microvascular traits derived\nthrough deep learning based image processing with serum lipidomic data to\nhighlight asymptomatic biomarkers of cardiovascular risk beyond the\nconventional lipid panel. This represents the first large scale, covariate\nadjusted and stratified correlation analysis conducted in a healthy population,\nwhich is essential for identifying early indicators of disease.

This\nrequires deleting or \"forgetting\" a set of data points from an already-trained\nmodel, which typically degrades its performance on other data points. Thus, a\nbalance must be struck between removing information and keeping the model's\nother abilities intact, with a failure to balance this trade-off leading to\npoor deletion or an unusable model. To this end, we propose UPCORE\n(Utility-Preserving Coreset Selection), a method-agnostic data selection\nframework for mitigating collateral damage during unlearning. Finding that the\nmodel damage is correlated with the variance of the model's representations on\nthe forget set, we selectively prune the forget set to remove outliers, thereby\nminimizing model degradation after unlearning. Across three standard unlearning\nmethods, UPCORE consistently achieves a superior balance between the competing\nobjectives of deletion efficacy and model preservation. To better evaluate this\ntrade-off, we introduce a new metric, measuring the area-under-the-curve (AUC)\nacross standard metrics.

However, extending these\ngains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains\na challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this\nintuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language\nModels(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge,\nhuman-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as\nverifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and\nrobotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a\nstrong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often\ngenerating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is\npervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several\nmethods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs\ndespite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To\naddress this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method\nthat enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing\ntheir own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV\noperates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors\nabout task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then,\nconditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate\ntrajectory.

For example, the user may ask to \"put\nthe two granny smith apples inside the basket\", but the agent cannot correctly\nidentify which objects in the environment are \"granny smith\" as the agent has\nnot been exposed to such a concept before. We introduce SECURE, an interactive\ntask learning policy designed to tackle such scenarios. The unique feature of\nSECURE is its ability to enable agents to engage in semantic analysis when\nprocessing embodied conversations and making decisions. Through embodied\nconversation, a SECURE agent adjusts its deficient domain model by engaging in\ndialogue to identify and learn about previously unforeseen possibilities. The\nSECURE agent learns from the user's embodied corrective feedback when mistakes\nare made and strategically engages in dialogue to uncover useful information\nabout novel concepts relevant to the task. These capabilities enable the SECURE\nagent to generalize to new tasks with the acquired knowledge.
