                                        <span>  Learning visuomotor policies via imitation has proven effective across a wide
range of robotic domains. However, the performance of these policies is heavily
dependent on the number of training demonstrations, which requires expensive
data collection in the real world. In this work, we aim to reduce data
collection efforts when learning visuomotor robot policies by leveraging
existing or cost-effective data from a wide range of embodiments, such as
public robot datasets and the datasets of humans playing with objects (human
data from play). Our approach leverages two key insights. First, we use optic
flow as an embodiment-agnostic action representation to train a World Model
(WM) across multi-embodiment datasets, and finetune it on a small amount of
robot data from the target embodiment. Second, we develop a method, Latent
Policy Steering (LPS), to improve the output of a behavior-cloned policy by
searching in the latent space of the WM for better action sequences. In real
world experiments, we observe significant improvements in the performance of
policies trained with a small amount of data (over 50% relative improvement
with 30 demonstrations and over 20% relative improvement with 50
demonstrations) by combining the policy with a WM pretrained on two thousand
episodes sampled from the existing Open X-embodiment dataset across different
robots or a cost-effective human dataset from play.

                                        <span>  Robots are increasingly integrated across industries, particularly in
healthcare. However, many valuable applications for quadrupedal robots remain
overlooked. This research explores the effectiveness of three reinforcement
learning algorithms in training a simulated quadruped robot for autonomous
navigation and obstacle avoidance. The goal is to develop a robotic guide dog
simulation capable of path following and obstacle avoidance, with long-term
potential for real-world assistance to guide dogs and visually impaired
individuals. It also seeks to expand research into medical 'pets', including
robotic guide and alert dogs.
  A comparative analysis of thirteen related research papers shaped key
evaluation criteria, including collision detection, pathfinding algorithms,
sensor usage, robot type, and simulation platforms. The study focuses on sensor
inputs, collision frequency, reward signals, and learning progression to
determine which algorithm best supports robotic navigation in complex
environments.
  Custom-made environments were used to ensure fair evaluation of all three
algorithms under controlled conditions, allowing consistent data collection.
Results show that Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) outperformed Deep
Q-Network (DQN) and Q-learning across all metrics, particularly in average and
median steps to goal per episode.
  By analysing these results, this study contributes to robotic navigation, AI
and medical robotics, offering insights into the feasibility of AI-driven
quadruped mobility and its role in assistive robotics.

                                        <span>  We present VITA, a Vision-To-Action flow matching policy that evolves latent
visual representations into latent actions for visuomotor control. Traditional
flow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions
(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like
cross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating
time and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent
images as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action
while eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative
modeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different
modalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data
lacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional
visual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a
structured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,
up-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we
supervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs
through flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss
through sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end
learning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging
bi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and
2 real-world tasks. Despite its simplicity, MLP-only VITA outperforms or
matches state-of-the-art generative policies while reducing inference latency
by 50-130% compared to conventional flow matching policies requiring different
conditioning mechanisms or complex architectures. To our knowledge, VITA is the
first MLP-only flow matching policy capable of solving complex bi-manual
manipulation tasks like those in ALOHA benchmarks.

                                        <span>  The pursuit of a generalizable stereo matching model, capable of performing
across varying resolutions and disparity ranges without dataset-specific
fine-tuning, has revealed a fundamental trade-off. Iterative local search
methods achieve high scores on constrained benchmarks, but their core mechanism
inherently limits the global consistency required for true generalization. On
the other hand, global matching architectures, while theoretically more robust,
have been historically rendered infeasible by prohibitive computational and
memory costs. We resolve this dilemma with $S^2M^2$: a global matching
architecture that achieves both state-of-the-art accuracy and high efficiency
without relying on cost volume filtering or deep refinement stacks. Our design
integrates a multi-resolution transformer for robust long-range correspondence,
trained with a novel loss function that concentrates probability on feasible
matches. This approach enables a more robust joint estimation of disparity,
occlusion, and confidence. $S^2M^2$ establishes a new state of the art on the
Middlebury v3 and ETH3D benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior methods
across most metrics while reconstructing high-quality details with competitive
efficiency.

planning and control to handle STL-based tasks in autonomous robots. The method
consists of two phases: $(i)$ learning spatio-temporal motion primitives to
encapsulate the inherent robot-specific constraints and $(ii)$ constructing an
STL-compliant motion plan from these primitives. Initially, we employ
reinforcement learning to construct a library of control policies that perform
trajectories described by the motion primitives. Then, we map motion primitives
to spatio-temporal characteristics. Subsequently, we present a sampling-based
STL-compliant motion planning strategy tailored to meet the STL specification.
The proposed model-free approach, which generates feasible STL-compliant motion
plans across various environments, is validated on differential-drive and
quadruped robots across various STL specifications. Demonstration videos are

                                        <span>  Tools extend the manipulation abilities of robots, much like they do for
humans. Despite human expertise in tool manipulation, teaching robots these
skills faces challenges. The complexity arises from the interplay of two
simultaneous points of contact: one between the robot and the tool, and another
between the tool and the environment. Tactile and proximity sensors play a
crucial role in identifying these complex contacts. However, learning tool
manipulation using these sensors remains challenging due to limited real-world
data and the large sim-to-real gap. To address this, we propose a few-shot
tool-use skill transfer framework using multimodal sensing. The framework
involves pre-training the base policy to capture contact states common in
tool-use skills in simulation and fine-tuning it with human demonstrations
collected in the real-world target domain to bridge the domain gap. We validate
that this framework enables teaching surface-following tasks using tools with
diverse physical and geometric properties with a small number of demonstrations
on the Franka Emika robot arm. Our analysis suggests that the robot acquires
new tool-use skills by transferring the ability to recognise tool-environment
contact relationships from pre-trained to fine-tuned policies. Additionally,
combining proximity and tactile sensors enhances the identification of contact
states and environmental geometry.

                                        <span>  Conventional reinforcement learning (RL) ap proaches often struggle to learn
effective policies under sparse reward conditions, necessitating the manual
design of complex, task-specific reward functions. To address this limitation,
rein forcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a promising
strategy that complements hand-crafted rewards with human-derived evaluation
signals. However, most existing RLHF methods depend on explicit feedback
mechanisms such as button presses or preference labels, which disrupt the
natural interaction process and impose a substantial cognitive load on the
user. We propose a novel reinforcement learning from implicit human feedback
(RLIHF) framework that utilizes non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG)
signals, specifically error-related potentials (ErrPs), to provide continuous,
implicit feedback without requiring explicit user intervention. The proposed
method adopts a pre-trained decoder to transform raw EEG signals into
probabilistic reward components, en abling effective policy learning even in
the presence of sparse external rewards. We evaluate our approach in a
simulation environment built on the MuJoCo physics engine, using a Kinova Gen2
robotic arm to perform a complex pick-and-place task that requires avoiding
obstacles while manipulating target objects. The results show that agents
trained with decoded EEG feedback achieve performance comparable to those
trained with dense, manually designed rewards. These findings validate the
potential of using implicit neural feedback for scalable and human-aligned
reinforcement learning in interactive robotics.

                                        <span>  Recent advances in vision-language navigation (VLN) were mainly attributed to
emerging large language models (LLMs). These methods exhibited excellent
generalization capabilities in instruction understanding and task reasoning.
However, they were constrained by the fixed knowledge bases and reasoning
abilities of LLMs, preventing fully incorporating experiential knowledge and
thus resulting in a lack of efficient evolutionary capacity. To address this,
we drew inspiration from the evolution capabilities of natural agents, and
proposed a self-evolving VLN framework (SE-VLN) to endow VLN agents with the
ability to continuously evolve during testing. To the best of our knowledge, it
was the first time that an multimodal LLM-powered self-evolving VLN framework
was proposed. Specifically, SE-VLN comprised three core modules, i.e., a
hierarchical memory module to transfer successful and failure cases into
reusable knowledge, a retrieval-augmented thought-based reasoning module to
retrieve experience and enable multi-step decision-making, and a reflection
module to realize continual evolution. Comprehensive tests illustrated that the
SE-VLN achieved navigation success rates of 57% and 35.2% in unseen
environments, representing absolute performance improvements of 23.9% and 15.0%
over current state-of-the-art methods on R2R and REVERSE datasets,
respectively. Moreover, the SE-VLN showed performance improvement with
increasing experience repository, elucidating its great potential as a
self-evolving agent framework for VLN.

generalization, and efficiency challenges in robotics. Recent advances in
visual foundation models, such as DINOv2, have improved robustness and
generalization in various vision tasks, yet their integration in VO remains
limited due to coarse feature granularity. In this paper, we present DINO-VO, a
feature-based VO system leveraging DINOv2 visual foundation model for its
sparse feature matching. To address the integration challenge, we propose a
salient keypoints detector tailored to DINOv2's coarse features. Furthermore,
we complement DINOv2's robust-semantic features with fine-grained geometric
features, resulting in more localizable representations. Finally, a
transformer-based matcher and differentiable pose estimation layer enable
precise camera motion estimation by learning good matches. Against prior
detector-descriptor networks like SuperPoint, DINO-VO demonstrates greater
robustness in challenging environments. Furthermore, we show superior accuracy
and generalization of the proposed feature descriptors against standalone
DINOv2 coarse features. DINO-VO outperforms prior frame-to-frame VO methods on
the TartanAir and KITTI datasets and is competitive on EuRoC dataset, while
running efficiently at 72 FPS with less than 1GB of memory usage on a single
GPU. Moreover, it performs competitively against Visual SLAM systems on outdoor
driving scenarios, showcasing its generalization capabilities.

application on real-time systems, such as robots, and often requires the use of
short prediction horizons. This not only affects the control performance, but
also increases the difficulty of designing MPC cost functions that reflect the
desired long-term objective. This paper proposes ZipMPC, a method that imitates
a long-horizon MPC behaviour by learning a compressed and context-dependent
cost function for a short-horizon MPC. It improves performance over alternative
methods, such as approximate explicit MPC and automatic cost parameter tuning,
in particular in terms of i) optimizing the long term objective; ii)
maintaining computational costs comparable to a short-horizon MPC; iii)
ensuring constraint satisfaction; and iv) generalizing control behaviour to
environments not observed during training. For this purpose, ZipMPC leverages
the concept of differentiable MPC with neural networks to propagate gradients
of the imitation loss through the MPC optimization. We validate our proposed
method in simulation and real-world experiments on autonomous racing. ZipMPC
consistently completes laps faster than selected baselines, achieving lap times
close to the long-horizon MPC baseline. In challenging scenarios where the
short-horizon MPC baseline fails to complete a lap, ZipMPC is able to do so. In
particular, these performance gains are also observed on tracks unseen during
training.

                                        <span>  Robotic information gathering (RIG) techniques refer to methods where mobile
robots are used to acquire data about the physical environment with a suite of
sensors. Informative planning is an important part of RIG where the goal is to
find sequences of actions or paths that maximize efficiency or the quality of
information collected. Many existing solutions solve this problem by assuming
that the environment is known in advance. However, real environments could be
unknown or time-varying, and adaptive informative planning remains an active
area of research. Adaptive planning and incremental online mapping are required
for mapping initially unknown or varying spatial fields. Gaussian process (GP)
regression is a widely used technique in RIG for mapping continuous spatial
fields. However, it falls short in many applications as its real-time
performance does not scale well to large datasets. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes an efficient adaptive informative planning approach for
mapping continuous scalar fields with GPs with streaming sparse GPs. Simulation
experiments are performed with a synthetic dataset and compared against
existing benchmarks. Finally, it is also verified with a real-world dataset to
further validate the efficacy of the proposed method. Results show that our
method achieves similar mapping accuracy to the baselines while reducing
computational complexity for longer missions.

have unlocked vast potential for human-computer interaction, particularly in
the field of robotic ultrasound. While existing research primarily focuses on
either patient-robot or physician-robot interaction, the role of an intelligent
virtual sonographer (IVS) bridging physician-robot-patient communication
remains underexplored. This work introduces a conversational virtual agent in
Extended Reality (XR) that facilitates real-time interaction between
physicians, a robotic ultrasound system(RUS), and patients. The IVS agent
communicates with physicians in a professional manner while offering empathetic
explanations and reassurance to patients. Furthermore, it actively controls the
RUS by executing physician commands and transparently relays these actions to
the patient. By integrating LLM-powered dialogue with speech-to-text,
text-to-speech, and robotic control, our system enhances the efficiency,
clarity, and accessibility of robotic ultrasound acquisition. This work
constitutes a first step toward understanding how IVS can bridge communication
gaps in physician-robot-patient interaction, providing more control and
therefore trust into physician-robot interaction while improving patient
experience and acceptance of robotic ultrasound.

                                        <span>  As robots find their way into more and more aspects of everyday life,
questions around trust are becoming increasingly important. What does it mean
to trust a robot? And how should we think about trust in relationships that
involve both humans and non-human agents? While the field of Human-Robot
Interaction (HRI) has made trust a central topic, the concept is often
approached in fragmented ways. At the same time, established work in sociology,
where trust has long been a key theme, is rarely brought into conversation with
developments in robotics. This article argues that we need a more
interdisciplinary approach. By drawing on insights from both social sciences
and social robotics, we explore how trust is shaped, tested and made visible.
Our goal is to open up a dialogue between disciplines and help build a more
grounded and adaptable framework for understanding trust in the evolving world
of human-robot interaction.

their idealized assumptions about robot movement and control fail to reflect
physically embodied deployment challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce
VLN-PE, a physically realistic VLN platform supporting humanoid, quadruped, and
wheeled robots. For the first time, we systematically evaluate several
ego-centric VLN methods in physical robotic settings across different technical
pipelines, including classification models for single-step discrete action
prediction, a diffusion model for dense waypoint prediction, and a train-free,
map-based large language model (LLM) integrated with path planning. Our results
reveal significant performance degradation due to limited robot observation
space, environmental lighting variations, and physical challenges like
collisions and falls. This also exposes locomotion constraints for legged
robots in complex environments. VLN-PE is highly extensible, allowing seamless
integration of new scenes beyond MP3D, thereby enabling more comprehensive VLN
evaluation. Despite the weak generalization of current models in physical
deployment, VLN-PE provides a new pathway for improving cross-embodiment's
overall adaptability. We hope our findings and tools inspire the community to
rethink VLN limitations and advance robust, practical VLN models. The code is

primarily due to the limited propulsion capabilities and constrained fuel
reserves onboard, which severely restrict the scope for large orbital
corrections. This limitation necessitates the development of more efficient
maneuvering techniques to ensure mission success. In this paper, we propose a
maneuvering sequence that exploits the natural J2 perturbation caused by the
Earth's oblateness. By utilizing the secular effects of this perturbation, it
is possible to passively influence key orbital parameters such as the argument
of perigee and the right ascension of the ascending node, thereby reducing the
need for extensive propulsion-based corrections. The approach is designed to
optimize the CubeSat's orbital insertion and minimize the total fuel required
for trajectory adjustments, making it particularly suitable for
fuel-constrained missions. The proposed methodology is validated through
comprehensive numerical simulations that examine different initial orbital
conditions and perturbation environments. Case studies are presented to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the J2-augmented strategy in achieving
accurate orbital insertion, showing a major reduction in fuel consumption
compared to traditional methods. The results underscore the potential of this
approach to extend the operational life and capabilities of CubeSats, offering
a viable solution for future low-Earth orbit missions.

systems, perception relies on sensors such as cameras to capture environmental
data, which is then processed by AI models to support decision-making. However,
degradation in sensor performance directly impacts input data quality and can
impair AI inference. Specifying safety requirements for all possible sensor
degradation scenarios leads to unmanageable complexity and inevitable gaps. In
this position paper, we present a novel framework that integrates camera noise
factor identification with situation coverage analysis to systematically elicit
robustness-related safety requirements for AI-based perception systems. We
focus specifically on camera degradation in the automotive domain. Building on
an existing framework for identifying degradation modes, we propose involving
domain, sensor, and safety experts, and incorporating Operational Design Domain
specifications to extend the degradation model by incorporating noise factors
relevant to AI performance. Situation coverage analysis is then applied to
identify representative operational contexts. This work marks an initial step
toward integrating noise factor analysis and situational coverage to support
principled formulation and completeness assessment of robustness requirements
for camera-based AI perception.

                                        <span>  Safe and effective motion planning is crucial for autonomous robots.
Diffusion models excel at capturing complex agent interactions, a fundamental
aspect of decision-making in dynamic environments. Recent studies have
successfully applied diffusion models to motion planning, demonstrating their
competence in handling complex scenarios and accurately predicting multi-modal
future trajectories. Despite their effectiveness, diffusion models have
limitations in training objectives, as they approximate data distributions
rather than explicitly capturing the underlying decision-making dynamics.
However, the crux of motion planning lies in non-differentiable downstream
objectives, such as safety (collision avoidance) and effectiveness
(goal-reaching), which conventional learning algorithms cannot directly
optimize. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-based training
scheme for diffusion motion planning models, enabling them to effectively learn
non-differentiable objectives that explicitly measure safety and effectiveness.
Specifically, we introduce a reward-weighted dynamic thresholding algorithm to
shape a dense reward signal, facilitating more effective training and
outperforming models trained with differentiable objectives. State-of-the-art
performance on pedestrian datasets (CrowdNav, ETH-UCY) compared to various
baselines demonstrates the versatility of our approach for safe and effective
motion planning.

provide ground truth (GT) trajectories for benchmarking SLAM algorithms.
However, the accuracy of MoCap-based GT trajectories is mainly affected by two
factors: spatiotemporal calibration errors between the MoCap system and the
device under test (DUT), and inherent MoCap jitter. Consequently, existing
benchmarks focus primarily on absolute translation error, as accurate
assessment of rotation and inter-frame errors remains challenging, hindering
thorough SLAM evaluation. This paper proposes MoCap2GT, a joint optimization
approach that integrates MoCap data and inertial measurement unit (IMU)
measurements from the DUT for generating high-precision GT trajectories.
MoCap2GT includes a robust state initializer to ensure global convergence,
introduces a higher-order B-spline pose parameterization on the SE(3) manifold
with variable time offset to effectively model MoCap factors, and employs a
degeneracy-aware measurement rejection strategy to enhance estimation accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate that MoCap2GT outperforms existing methods and
significantly contributes to precise SLAM benchmarking. The source code is

that deviate from the training domain, often leading to unexpected and
potentially hazardous behavior from planners that lack prior exposure to such
cases. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been introduced into
autonomous driving research for their promising generalization capabilities in
OOD settings. Early studies demonstrated that VLMs could recognize OOD
scenarios and generate user-level decisions such as "go straight" or "turn
right." However, a new challenge has emerged due to the misalignment between
the VLM's high-level decisions or visual reasoning expressed in language, and
the low-level predicted trajectories interpreted as actions. In this paper, we
propose LaViPlan, a framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize VLMs using planning-oriented metrics.
This approach addresses the vision-language-action misalignment observed in
existing VLMs fine-tuned via supervised learning, which can recognize driving
scenarios but often produce context-unaware decisions. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method improves situational awareness and decision-making
under OOD conditions, highlighting its potential to mitigate the misalignment
issue. This work introduces a promising post-training paradigm for VLM agents
in the context of autonomous driving.

robotic arms, is foundational for solving challenging tasks. Despite recent
progress in general-purpose manipulation, data scarcity and embodiment
heterogeneity remain serious obstacles to further scaling up in bimanual
settings. In this paper, we introduce VIdeo Diffusion for Action Reasoning
(VIDAR), a two-stage framework that leverages large-scale, diffusion-based
video pre-training and a novel masked inverse dynamics model for action
prediction. We pre-train the video diffusion model on 750K multi-view videos
from three real-world bimanual robot platforms, utilizing a unified observation
space that encodes robot, camera, task, and scene contexts. Our masked inverse
dynamics model learns masks to extract action-relevant information from
generated trajectories without requiring pixel-level labels, and the masks can
effectively generalize to unseen backgrounds. Our experiments demonstrate that
with only 20 minutes of human demonstrations on an unseen robot platform (only
1% of typical data requirements), VIDAR generalizes to unseen tasks and
backgrounds with strong semantic understanding, surpassing state-of-the-art
methods. Our findings highlight the potential of video foundation models,
coupled with masked action prediction, to enable scalable and generalizable
robotic manipulation in diverse real-world settings.

demonstrated significant potential in various settings, such as task completion
with a robotic manipulator. A main reason for this success is the ability of
LLMs to perform in-context learning, which, however, strongly relies on the
design of task examples, closely related to the target tasks. Consequently,
employing LLMs to formulate optimal control problems often requires task
examples that contain explicit mathematical expressions, designed by trained
engineers. Furthermore, there is often no principled way to evaluate for
hallucination before task execution. To address these challenges, we propose
DEMONSTRATE, a novel methodology that avoids the use of LLMs for complex
optimization problem generations, and instead only relies on the embedding
representations of task descriptions. To do this, we leverage tools from
inverse optimal control to replace in-context prompt examples with task
demonstrations, as well as the concept of multitask learning, which ensures
target and example task similarity by construction. Given the fact that
hardware demonstrations can easily be collected using teleoperation or guidance
of the robot, our approach significantly reduces the reliance on engineering
expertise for designing in-context examples. Furthermore, the enforced
multitask structure enables learning from few demonstrations and assessment of
hallucinations prior to task execution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method through simulation and hardware experiments involving a robotic arm
tasked with tabletop manipulation.

                                        <span>  As robots become increasingly capable of operating over extended periods --
spanning days, weeks, and even months -- they are expected to accumulate
knowledge of their environments and leverage this experience to assist humans
more effectively. This paper studies the problem of Long-term Active Embodied
Question Answering (LA-EQA), a new task in which a robot must both recall past
experiences and actively explore its environment to answer complex,
temporally-grounded questions. Unlike traditional EQA settings, which typically
focus either on understanding the present environment alone or on recalling a
single past observation, LA-EQA challenges an agent to reason over past,
present, and possible future states, deciding when to explore, when to consult
its memory, and when to stop gathering observations and provide a final answer.
Standard EQA approaches based on large models struggle in this setting due to
limited context windows, absence of persistent memory, and an inability to
combine memory recall with active exploration. To address this, we propose a
structured memory system for robots, inspired by the mind palace method from
cognitive science. Our method encodes episodic experiences as scene-graph-based
world instances, forming a reasoning and planning algorithm that enables
targeted memory retrieval and guided navigation. To balance the
exploration-recall trade-off, we introduce value-of-information-based stopping
criteria that determines when the agent has gathered sufficient information. We
evaluate our method on real-world experiments and introduce a new benchmark
that spans popular simulation environments and actual industrial sites. Our
approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding
substantial gains in both answer accuracy and exploration efficiency.

self-navigation, achieving balance between efficiency and robustness in task
environment still remains challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel visual
and repeat robotic autonomous navigation method that requires no accurate
localization and dense reconstruction modules, which makes our system featured
by lightweight and robustness. Firstly, feature flow is introduced and we
develop a qualitative mapping between feature flow and robot's motion, in which
feature flow is defined as pixel location bias between matched features. Based
on the mapping model, the map outputted by the teaching phase is represented as
a keyframe graph, in which the feature flow on the edge encodes the relative
motion between adjacent keyframes. Secondly, the visual repeating navigation is
essentially modeled as a feature flow minimization problem between current
observation and the map keyframe. To drive the robot to consistently reduce the
feature flow between current frame and map keyframes without accurate
localization, a probabilistic motion planning is developed based on our

                                        <span>  Vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise on task-conditioned
control in complex settings such as bimanual manipulation. However, the heavy
reliance on task-specific human demonstrations limits their generalization and
incurs high data acquisition costs. In this work, we present a new notion of
task-agnostic action paradigm that decouples action execution from
task-specific conditioning, enhancing scalability, efficiency, and
cost-effectiveness. To address the data collection challenges posed by this
paradigm -- such as low coverage density, behavioral redundancy, and safety
risks -- we introduce ATARA (Automated Task-Agnostic Random Actions), a
scalable self-supervised framework that accelerates collection by over $
30\times $ compared to human teleoperation. To further enable effective
learning from task-agnostic data, which often suffers from distribution
mismatch and irrelevant trajectories, we propose AnyPos, an inverse dynamics
model equipped with Arm-Decoupled Estimation and a Direction-Aware Decoder
(DAD). We additionally integrate a video-conditioned action validation module
to verify the feasibility of learned policies across diverse manipulation
tasks. Extensive experiments show that the AnyPos-ATARA pipeline yields a 51%
improvement in test accuracy and achieves 30-40% higher success rates in
downstream tasks such as lifting, pick-and-place, and clicking, using
replay-based video validation. Project Page:

real-time tracking of marine animals, specifically sharks, in dynamic marine
environments. The system integrates an onboard computer with a stabilised RGB-D
camera and a custom-trained OSTrack pipeline, enabling visual identification
under challenging lighting, occlusion, and sea-state conditions. A key
innovation is the inter-UAV handoff protocol, which enables seamless transfer
of tracking responsibilities between drones, extending operational coverage
beyond single-drone battery limitations. Performance is evaluated on a curated
shark dataset of 5,200 frames, achieving a tracking success rate of 81.9\%
during real-time flight control at 100 Hz, and robustness to occlusion,
illumination variation, and background clutter. We present a seamless UAV
handoff framework, where target transfer is attempted via high-confidence
feature matching, achieving 82.9\% target coverage. These results confirm the
viability of coordinated UAV operations for extended marine tracking and lay
the groundwork for scalable, autonomous monitoring.

                                        <span>  Recent open-vocabulary robot mapping methods enrich dense geometric maps with
pre-trained visual-language features, achieving a high level of detail and
guiding robots to find objects specified by open-vocabulary language queries.
While the issue of scalability for such approaches has received some attention,
another fundamental problem is that high-detail object mapping quickly becomes
outdated, as objects get moved around a lot. In this work, we develop a mapping
and navigation system for object-goal navigation that, from the ground up,
considers the possibilities that a queried object can have moved, or may not be
mapped at all. Instead of striving for high-fidelity mapping detail, we
consider that the main purpose of a map is to provide environment grounding and
context, which we combine with the semantic priors of LLMs to reason about
object locations and deploy an active, online approach to navigate to the
objects. Through simulated and real-world experiments we find that our approach
tends to have higher retrieval success at shorter path lengths for static
objects and by far outperforms prior approaches in cases of dynamic or unmapped
object queries. We provide our code and dataset at:

                                        <span>  Energy efficiency is a critical factor in the performance and autonomy of
quadrupedal robots. While previous research has focused on mechanical design
and actuation improvements, the impact of gait parameters on energetics has
been less explored. In this paper, we hypothesize that gait parameters,
specifically duty factor, phase shift, and stride duration, are key
determinants of energy consumption in quadrupedal locomotion. To test this
hypothesis, we modeled the Unitree A1 quadrupedal robot and developed a
locomotion controller capable of independently adjusting these gait parameters.
Simulations of bounding gaits were conducted in Gazebo across a range of gait
parameters at three different speeds: low, medium, and high. Experimental tests
were also performed to validate the simulation results. The findings
demonstrate that optimizing gait parameters can lead to significant reductions
in energy consumption, enhancing the overall efficiency of quadrupedal
locomotion. This work contributes to the advancement of energy-efficient
control strategies for legged robots, offering insights directly applicable to
commercially available platforms.

architectures, traditional high-performance vision models have undergone
significant compression, greatly improving their computational efficiency and
energy consumption ratio. This makes them feasible for deployment on
resource-constrained edge computing devices. We propose a visual-assisted
navigation framework called Atrous Strip Convolution-Sliding Window (ASC-SW),
which leverages a depth camera and a lightweight visual neural network to
assist map-based mobile robot navigation. This framework compensates for the
inability of traditional light detection and range (LiDAR) sensors to detect
ground-level obstacles such as ground-level wires. We introduce a lightweight
and efficient segmentation model, Atrous Strip Convolution Network (ASCnet),
for detecting deformable linear objects (DLOs). MobileNetV2 is used as the
backbone network, and Atrous Strip Convolution Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASCSPP)
is designed to extract DLO features more effectively. Atrous Strip Convolution
is integrated into ASCSPP to accurately identify the linear structure of DLOs
with low computational cost. Additionally, a Sliding Window (SW)
post-processing module is proposed to denoise the output in complex
environments, improving recognition accuracy. Our method strikes a balance
between inference speed and segmentation performance. It achieves a mean
Intersection over Union (Miou) score of 75.3% on a self-built dataset and
reaches 9.3 FPS inference speed on the Jetson Orin Nano edge device. Overall,
our approach outperforms existing DLO detection models and has been
successfully validated on a physical robotic platform.

challenge. This study evaluates public perception and potential social impacts
of fully autonomous CAs for physical support in daily life. To this end, we
conducted a large-scale demonstration and survey during Avatar Land, a 19-day
public event in Osaka, Japan, where fully autonomous robotic CAs, alongside
semi-autonomous CAs, performed daily object retrieval tasks. Specifically, we
analyzed responses from 2,285 visitors who engaged with various CAs, including
a subset of 333 participants who interacted with fully autonomous CAs and
shared their perceptions and concerns through a survey questionnaire. The
survey results indicate interest in CAs for physical support in daily life and

contrast, cost and human-like interaction were not dominant concerns. Project

                                        <span>  Navigating in off-road environments for wheeled mobile robots is challenging
due to dynamic and rugged terrain. Traditional physics-based stability metrics,
such as Static Stability Margin (SSM) or Zero Moment Point (ZMP) require
knowledge of contact forces, terrain geometry, and the robot's precise
center-of-mass that are difficult to measure accurately in real-world field
conditions. In this work, we propose a learning-based approach to estimate
robot platform stability directly from proprioceptive data using a lightweight
neural network, IMUnet. Our method enables data-driven inference of robot
stability without requiring an explicit terrain model or force sensing.
  We also develop a novel vision-based ArUco tracking method to compute a
scalar score to quantify robot platform stability called C3 score. The score
captures image-space perturbations over time as a proxy for physical
instability and is used as a training signal for the neural network based
model. As a pilot study, we evaluate our approach on data collected across
multiple terrain types and speeds and demonstrate generalization to previously
unseen conditions. These initial results highlight the potential of using IMU
and robot velocity as inputs to estimate platform stability. The proposed
method finds application in gating robot tasks such as precision actuation and
sensing, especially for mobile manipulation tasks in agricultural and space
applications. Our learning method also provides a supervision mechanism for
perception based traversability estimation and planning.

                                        <span>  Soil moisture is a quantity of interest in many application areas including
agriculture and climate modeling. Existing methods are not suitable for scale
applications due to large deployment costs in high-resolution sensing
applications such as for variable irrigation. In this work, we design, build
and field deploy an autonomous mobile robot, MoistureMapper, for soil moisture
sensing. The robot is equipped with Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) sensors and
a direct push drill mechanism for deploying the sensor to measure volumetric
water content in the soil. Additionally, we implement and evaluate multiple
adaptive sampling strategies based on a Gaussian Process based modeling to
build a spatial mapping of moisture distribution in the soil. We present
results from large scale computational simulations and proof-of-concept
deployment on the field. The adaptive sampling approach outperforms a greedy
benchmark approach and results in up to 30\% reduction in travel distance and
5\% reduction in variance in the reconstructed moisture maps. Link to video

                                        <span>  Real robot data collection for imitation learning has led to significant
advancements in robotic manipulation. However, the requirement for robot
hardware in the process fundamentally constrains the scale of the data. In this
paper, we explore training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using egocentric
human videos. The benefit of using human videos is not only for their scale but
more importantly for the richness of scenes and tasks. With a VLA trained on
human video that predicts human wrist and hand actions, we can perform Inverse
Kinematics and retargeting to convert the human actions to robot actions. We
fine-tune the model using a few robot manipulation demonstrations to obtain the
robot policy, namely EgoVLA. We propose a simulation benchmark called Ego
Humanoid Manipulation Benchmark, where we design diverse bimanual manipulation
tasks with demonstrations. We fine-tune and evaluate EgoVLA with Ego Humanoid
Manipulation Benchmark and show significant improvements over baselines and
ablate the importance of human data. Videos can be found on our website:

                                        <span>  In recent years, the advancement of imitation learning has led to increased
interest in teleoperating low-cost manipulators to collect demonstration data.
However, most existing systems rely on unilateral control, which only transmits
target position values. While this approach is easy to implement and suitable
for slow, non-contact tasks, it struggles with fast or contact-rich operations
due to the absence of force feedback. This work demonstrates that fast
teleoperation with force feedback is feasible even with force-sensorless,
low-cost manipulators by leveraging 4-channel bilateral control. Based on
accurately identified manipulator dynamics, our method integrates nonlinear
terms compensation, velocity and external force estimation, and variable gain
corresponding to inertial variation. Furthermore, using data collected by
4-channel bilateral control, we show that incorporating force information into
both the input and output of learned policies improves performance in imitation
learning. These results highlight the practical effectiveness of our system for
high-fidelity teleoperation and data collection on affordable hardware.

presents a roadmap for climate-relevant robotics research, identifying
high-impact opportunities for collaboration between roboticists and experts
across climate domains such as energy, the built environment, transportation,
industry, land use, and Earth sciences. These applications include problems
such as energy systems optimization, construction, precision agriculture,
building envelope retrofits, autonomous trucking, and large-scale environmental
monitoring. Critically, we include opportunities to apply not only physical
robots but also the broader robotics toolkit - including planning, perception,
control, and estimation algorithms - to climate-relevant problems. A central
goal of this roadmap is to inspire new research directions and collaboration by
highlighting specific, actionable problems at the intersection of robotics and
climate. This work represents a collaboration between robotics researchers and
domain experts in various climate disciplines, and it serves as an invitation
to the robotics community to bring their expertise to bear on urgent climate
priorities.

(e.g. when manipulating one or multiple symmetric objects), the ideal planning
algorithm should take advantage of those symmetries to produce shorter

algorithms. We demonstrate how the key primitives used for sampling-based
planning can be efficiently implemented in spaces with finite symmetries. A
rigorous theoretical analysis, building upon a study of the geometry of the

                                        <span>  Reinforcement Learning (RL) has the potential to enable extreme off-road
mobility by circumventing complex kinodynamic modeling, planning, and control
by simulated end-to-end trial-and-error learning experiences. However, most RL
methods are sample-inefficient when training in a large amount of manually
designed simulation environments and struggle at generalizing to the real
world. To address these issues, we introduce VertiSelector (VS), an automatic
curriculum learning framework designed to enhance learning efficiency and
generalization by selectively sampling training terrain. VS prioritizes
vertically challenging terrain with higher Temporal Difference (TD) errors when
revisited, thereby allowing robots to learn at the edge of their evolving
capabilities. By dynamically adjusting the sampling focus, VS significantly
boosts sample efficiency and generalization within the VW-Chrono simulator
built on the Chrono multi-physics engine. Furthermore, we provide simulation
and physical results using VS on a Verti-4-Wheeler platform. These results
demonstrate that VS can achieve 23.08% improvement in terms of success rate by
efficiently sampling during training and robustly generalizing to the real
world.

                                        <span>  Learning-based decision-making has the potential to enable generalizable
Autonomous Driving (AD) policies, reducing the engineering overhead of
rule-based approaches. Imitation Learning (IL) remains the dominant paradigm,
benefiting from large-scale human demonstration datasets, but it suffers from
inherent limitations such as distribution shift and imitation gaps.
Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a promising alternative, yet its adoption
in AD remains limited due to the lack of standardized and efficient research
frameworks. To this end, we introduce V-Max, an open research framework
providing all the necessary tools to make RL practical for AD. V-Max is built
on Waymax, a hardware-accelerated AD simulator designed for large-scale
experimentation. We extend it using ScenarioNet's approach, enabling the fast
simulation of diverse AD datasets.

user experiences, particularly in cultural and educational settings. This paper
presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of the autonomous museum
guide robot Alter-Ego equipped with advanced navigation and interactive
capabilities. The robot leverages state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs)
to provide real-time, context aware question-and-answer (Q&A) interactions,
allowing visitors to engage in conversations about exhibits. It also employs
robust simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) techniques, enabling
seamless navigation through museum spaces and route adaptation based on user
requests. The system was tested in a real museum environment with 34
participants, combining qualitative analysis of visitor-robot conversations and
quantitative analysis of pre and post interaction surveys. Results showed that
the robot was generally well-received and contributed to an engaging museum
experience, despite some limitations in comprehension and responsiveness. This
study sheds light on HRI in cultural spaces, highlighting not only the
potential of AI-driven robotics to support accessibility and knowledge
acquisition, but also the current limitations and challenges of deploying such
technologies in complex, real-world environments.

                                        <span>  This letter proposes a new approach for Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)
preintegration, a fundamental building block that can be leveraged in different
optimization-based Inertial Navigation System (INS) localization solutions.
Inspired by recent advances in equivariant theory applied to biased INSs, we
derive a discrete-time formulation of the IMU preintegration on
${\mathbf{Gal}(3) \ltimes \mathfrak{gal}(3)}$, the left-trivialization of the
tangent group of the Galilean group $\mathbf{Gal}(3)$. We define a novel
preintegration error that geometrically couples the navigation states and the
bias leading to lower linearization error. Our method improves in consistency
compared to existing preintegration approaches which treat IMU biases as a
separate state-space. Extensive validation against state-of-the-art methods,
both in simulation and with real-world IMU data, implementation in the Lie++
library, and open-source code are provided.

measurement units, and wireless and wired communication channels required for
robotics projects. They are affordable, portable, and programmable, which makes
them ideal for testing, data acquisition, controlling mobile robots, and many
other robotic applications. A robotic system is proposed in this paper,
consisting of an Android phone, a microcontroller board attached to the phone
via USB, and a remote wireless controller station. In the data acquisition
mode, the Android device can record a dataset of a diverse configuration of
multiple cameras, IMUs, GNSS units, and external USB ADC channels in the rawest
format used for, but not limited to, pose estimation and scene reconstruction
applications. In robot control mode, the Android phone, a microcontroller
board, and other peripherals constitute the mobile or stationary robotic
system. This system is controlled using a remote server connected over Wi-Fi or
Bluetooth. Experiments show that although the SLAM and AR applications can
utilize the acquired data, the proposed system can pave the way for more
advanced algorithms for processing these noisy and sporadic measurements.
Moreover, the characteristics of the communication media are studied, and two
example robotic projects, which involve controlling a toy car and a quadcopter,
are included.

                                        <span>  Positioning integrity refers to the trust in the performance of a navigation
system. Accurate and reliable position information is needed to meet the
requirements of connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) applications,
particularly in safety-critical scenarios. Receiver Autonomous Integrity
Monitoring (RAIM) and its variants have been widely studied for Global
Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-based vehicle positioning, often fused with
kinematic (e.g., Odometry) and perception sensors (e.g., camera). However,
integrity monitoring (IM) for cooperative positioning solutions leveraging
Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication has received comparatively limited
attention. This paper reviews existing research in the field of positioning IM
and identifies various research gaps. Particular attention has been placed on
identifying research that highlights cooperative IM methods. It also examines
key automotive safety standards and public V2X datasets to map current research
priorities and uncover critical gaps. Finally, the paper outlines promising
future directions, highlighting research topics aimed at advancing and
benchmarking positioning integrity.

                                        <span>  Learning from human demonstrations is an emerging trend for designing
intelligent robotic systems. However, previous methods typically regard videos
as instructions, simply dividing them into action sequences for robotic
repetition, which poses obstacles to generalization to diverse tasks or object
instances. In this paper, we propose a different perspective, considering human
demonstration videos not as mere instructions, but as a source of knowledge for
robots. Motivated by this perspective and the remarkable comprehension and
generalization capabilities exhibited by large language models (LLMs), we
propose DigKnow, a method that DIstills Generalizable KNOWledge with a
hierarchical structure. Specifically, DigKnow begins by converting human
demonstration video frames into observation knowledge. This knowledge is then
subjected to analysis to extract human action knowledge and further distilled
into pattern knowledge compassing task and object instances, resulting in the
acquisition of generalizable knowledge with a hierarchical structure. In
settings with different tasks or object instances, DigKnow retrieves relevant
knowledge for the current task and object instances. Subsequently, the
LLM-based planner conducts planning based on the retrieved knowledge, and the
policy executes actions in line with the plan to achieve the designated task.
Utilizing the retrieved knowledge, we validate and rectify planning and
execution outcomes, resulting in a substantial enhancement of the success rate.
Experimental results across a range of tasks and scenes demonstrate the
effectiveness of this approach in facilitating real-world robots to accomplish
tasks with the knowledge derived from human demonstrations.

framework that combines Bird's Eye View (BEV) image representations of LiDAR
data with geometry-based point cloud registration and incorporates loop closure
(LC) through BEV image features. By normalizing point density, we project LiDAR
point clouds into BEV images, thereby enabling efficient feature extraction and
matching. A lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) based feature
extractor is employed to extract distinctive local and global descriptors from
the BEV images. Local descriptors are used to match BEV images with FAST
keypoints for reprojection error construction, while global descriptors
facilitate loop closure detection. Reprojection error minimization is then
integrated with point-to-plane registration within an iterated Extended Kalman
Filter (iEKF). In the back-end, global descriptors are used to create a
KD-tree-indexed keyframe database for accurate loop closure detection. When a
loop closure is detected, Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) computes a coarse
transform from BEV image matching, which serves as the initial estimate for
Iterative Closest Point (ICP). The refined transform is subsequently
incorporated into a factor graph along with odometry factors, improving the
global consistency of localization. Extensive experiments conducted in various
scenarios with different LiDAR types demonstrate that BEV-LIO(LC) outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving competitive localization accuracy. Our code

RGBD-inertial SLAM for legged robotics undergoing aggressive and high-frequency
motions.By integrating geometric consistency, legged odometry constraints, and
dual-stream optical flow (GeoFlow), our method addresses three critical
challenges:feature matching and pose initialization failures during fast
locomotion and visual feature scarcity in texture-less scenes.Specifically, in
rapid motion scenarios, feature matching is notably enhanced by leveraging
dual-stream optical flow, which combines prior map points and poses.
Additionally, we propose a robust pose initialization method for fast
locomotion and IMU error in legged robots, integrating IMU/Legged odometry,
inter-frame Perspective-n-Point (PnP), and Generalized Iterative Closest Point
(GICP). Furthermore, a novel optimization framework that tightly couples
depth-to-map and GICP geometric constraints is first introduced to improve the
robustness and accuracy in long-duration, visually texture-less environments.
The proposed algorithms achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) on collected legged
robots and open-source datasets. To further promote research and development,

low-cost. They play a crucial role in the early detection of health problems
and in assessing their progression. However, they are also error-prone
activities, which require highly skilled medical staff. The use of robotic
solutions can be key to decreasing the inherent subjectivity of the results and
reducing the waiting list. For a robot to perform palpation or ultrasound
scans, it must effectively manage physical interactions with the human body,
which greatly benefits from precise estimation of the patient's tissue
biomechanical properties. This paper assesses the accuracy and precision of a
robotic system in estimating the viscoelastic parameters of various materials,
including some tests on ex vivo tissues as a preliminary proof-of-concept
demonstration of the method's applicability to biological samples. The
measurements are compared against a ground truth derived from silicone
specimens with different viscoelastic properties, characterised using a
high-precision instrument. Experimental results show that the robotic system's
accuracy closely matches the ground truth, increasing confidence in the
potential use of robots for such clinical applications.

integrating image generation with action prediction to improve generalization
and reasoning in robot manipulation. However, existing methods are limited to
challenging image-based forecasting, which suffers from redundant information
and lacks comprehensive and critical world knowledge, including dynamic,
spatial and semantic information. To address these limitations, we propose
DreamVLA, a novel VLA framework that integrates comprehensive world knowledge
forecasting to enable inverse dynamics modeling, thereby establishing a
perception-prediction-action loop for manipulation tasks. Specifically,
DreamVLA introduces a dynamic-region-guided world knowledge prediction,
integrated with the spatial and semantic cues, which provide compact yet
comprehensive representations for action planning. This design aligns with how
humans interact with the world by first forming abstract multimodal reasoning
chains before acting. To mitigate interference among the dynamic, spatial and
semantic information during training, we adopt a block-wise structured
attention mechanism that masks their mutual attention, preventing information
leakage and keeping each representation clean and disentangled. Moreover, to
model the conditional distribution over future actions, we employ a
diffusion-based transformer that disentangles action representations from
shared latent features. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulation
environments demonstrate that DreamVLA achieves 76.7% success rate on real
robot tasks and 4.44 average length on the CALVIN ABC-D benchmarks.

imposing significant human, societal, and economic burdens. Human-machine
shared collision avoidance in critical collision scenarios aims to aid drivers'
accident avoidance through intervening only when necessary. Existing methods
count on replanning collision-free trajectories and imposing human-machine
tracking, which usually interrupts the driver's intent and increases the risk
of conflict. This paper introduces a Reachability-Aware Reinforcement Learning
(RL) framework for shared control, guided by Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability
analysis. Machine intervention is activated only when the vehicle approaches
the Collision Avoidance Reachable Set (CARS), which represents states where
collision is unavoidable. First, we precompute the reachability distributions
and the CARS by solving the Bellman equation using offline data. To reduce
human-machine conflicts, we develop a driver model for sudden obstacles and
propose an authority allocation strategy considering key collision avoidance
features. Finally, we train a RL agent to reduce human-machine conflicts while
enforcing the hard constraint of avoiding entry into the CARS. The proposed
method was tested on a real vehicle platform. Results show that the controller
intervenes effectively near CARS to prevent collisions while maintaining
improved original driving task performance. Robustness analysis further
supports its flexibility across different driver attributes.

                                        <span>  Flow matching has emerged as a compelling generative modeling approach that
is widely used across domains. To generate data via a flow matching model, an
ordinary differential equation (ODE) is numerically solved via forward
integration of the modeled velocity field. To better capture the multi-modality
that is inherent in typical velocity fields, hierarchical flow matching was
recently introduced. It uses a hierarchy of ODEs that are numerically
integrated when generating data. This hierarchy of ODEs captures the
multi-modal velocity distribution just like vanilla flow matching is capable of
modeling a multi-modal data distribution. While this hierarchy enables to model
multi-modal velocity distributions, the complexity of the modeled distribution
remains identical across levels of the hierarchy. In this paper, we study how
to gradually adjust the complexity of the distributions across different levels
of the hierarchy via mini-batch couplings. We show the benefits of mini-batch
couplings in hierarchical rectified flow matching via compelling results on
synthetic and imaging data. Code is available at

                                        <span>  Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved
performance by increasing the number of visual tokens, which are often
significantly longer than text tokens. However, we observe that most real-world
scenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the
performance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models
still perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4
resolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with
different resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression,
namely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides
whether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output
a special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing
Efficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or
thresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by
case. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding
capability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens
on simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge
strategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully
design a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and
reasonable image resize call ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority, efficiency, and effectiveness of our method. Our code is available

                                        <span>  Learning visuomotor policies via imitation has proven effective across a wide
range of robotic domains. However, the performance of these policies is heavily
dependent on the number of training demonstrations, which requires expensive
data collection in the real world. In this work, we aim to reduce data
collection efforts when learning visuomotor robot policies by leveraging
existing or cost-effective data from a wide range of embodiments, such as
public robot datasets and the datasets of humans playing with objects (human
data from play). Our approach leverages two key insights. First, we use optic
flow as an embodiment-agnostic action representation to train a World Model
(WM) across multi-embodiment datasets, and finetune it on a small amount of
robot data from the target embodiment. Second, we develop a method, Latent
Policy Steering (LPS), to improve the output of a behavior-cloned policy by
searching in the latent space of the WM for better action sequences. In real
world experiments, we observe significant improvements in the performance of
policies trained with a small amount of data (over 50% relative improvement
with 30 demonstrations and over 20% relative improvement with 50
demonstrations) by combining the policy with a WM pretrained on two thousand
episodes sampled from the existing Open X-embodiment dataset across different
robots or a cost-effective human dataset from play.

                                        <span>  Neural networks are often highly sensitive to input and weight perturbations.
This sensitivity has been linked to pathologies such as vulnerability to
adversarial examples, divergent training, and overfitting. To combat these
problems, past research has looked at building neural networks entirely from
Lipschitz components. However, these techniques have not matured to the point
where researchers have trained a modern architecture such as a transformer with
a Lipschitz certificate enforced beyond initialization. To explore this gap, we
begin by developing and benchmarking novel, computationally-efficient tools for
maintaining norm-constrained weight matrices. Applying these tools, we are able
to train transformer models with Lipschitz bounds enforced throughout training.
We find that optimizer dynamics matter: switching from AdamW to Muon improves
standard methods -- weight decay and spectral normalization -- allowing models
to reach equal performance with a lower Lipschitz bound. Inspired by Muon's
update having a fixed spectral norm, we co-design a weight constraint method
that improves the Lipschitz vs. performance tradeoff on MLPs and 2M parameter
transformers. Our 2-Lipschitz transformer on Shakespeare text reaches
validation accuracy 60%. Scaling to 145M parameters, our 10-Lipschitz
transformer reaches 21% accuracy on internet text. However, to match the
NanoGPT baseline validation accuracy of 39.4%, our Lipschitz upper bound
increases to 10^264. Nonetheless, our Lipschitz transformers train without
stability measures such as layer norm, QK norm, and logit tanh softcapping.

levels, are crucial to shaping policy decisions and fostering sustainable
development. This research introduces GeoReg a regression model that integrates
diverse data sources, including satellite imagery and web-based geospatial
information, to estimate these indicators even for data-scarce regions such as
developing countries. Our approach leverages the prior knowledge of large
language model (LLM) to address the scarcity of labeled data, with the LLM
functioning as a data engineer by extracting informative features to enable
effective estimation in few-shot settings. Specifically, our model obtains
contextual relationships between data features and the target indicator,
categorizing their correlations as positive, negative, mixed, or irrelevant.
These features are then fed into the linear estimator with tailored weight
constraints for each category. To capture nonlinear patterns, the model also
identifies meaningful feature interactions and integrates them, along with
nonlinear transformations. Experiments across three countries at different
stages of development demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines in
estimating socio-economic indicators, even for low-income countries with
limited data availability.

Artificial Intelligence and the Social Sciences. Social Science research
emphasizes the need to jointly model dynamics and relations, while practical
applications demand unified models capable of inferring multiple team
constructs simultaneously, providing interpretable insights and actionable
recommendations to enhance team performance. However, existing works do not
meet these practical demands. To bridge this gap, we present TRENN, a novel
tempo-relational architecture that integrates: (i) an automatic temporal graph
extractor, (ii) a tempo-relational encoder, (iii) a decoder for team construct
prediction, and (iv) two complementary explainability modules. TRENN jointly
captures relational and temporal team dynamics, providing a solid foundation
for MT-TRENN, which extends TReNN by replacing the decoder with a multi-task
head, enabling the model to learn shared Social Embeddings and simultaneously
predict multiple team constructs, including Emergent Leadership, Leadership
Style, and Teamwork components. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms approaches that rely exclusively on temporal
or relational information. Additionally, experimental evaluation has shown that
the explainability modules integrated in MT-TRENN yield interpretable insights

our approach particularly well-suited for Human-Centered AI applications, such
as intelligent decision-support systems in high-stakes collaborative

derives optimally-weighted empirical risk minimization procedures under
temporal distribution shifts. Our approach is theoretically grounded in the
random distribution shift model, where random shifts arise as a superposition
of numerous unpredictable changes in the data-generating process. We show that
common weighting schemes, such as pooling all data, exponentially weighting
data, and using only the most recent data, emerge naturally as special cases in
our framework. We demonstrate that RIDER consistently improves out-of-sample
predictive performance when applied as a fine-tuning step on the Yearbook
dataset, across a range of benchmark methods in Wild-Time. Moreover, we show
that RIDER outperforms standard weighting strategies in two other real-world
tasks: predicting stock market volatility and forecasting ride durations in NYC
taxi data.

                                        <span>  An increasing number of studies have focused on stochastic first-order
methods (SFOMs) under heavy-tailed gradient noises, which have been observed in
the training of practical deep learning models. In this paper, we focus on two
types of gradient noises: one is sub-Weibull noise, and the other is noise
under the assumption that it has a bounded $p$-th central moment ($p$-BCM) with
$p\in (1, 2]$. The latter is more challenging due to the occurrence of infinite
variance when $p\in (1, 2)$. Under these two gradient noise assumptions, the
in-expectation and high-probability convergence of SFOMs have been extensively
studied in the contexts of convex optimization and standard smooth
optimization. However, for weakly convex objectives-a class that includes all
Lipschitz-continuous convex objectives and smooth objectives-our understanding
of the in-expectation and high-probability convergence of SFOMs under these two
types of noises remains incomplete. We investigate the high-probability
convergence of the vanilla stochastic subgradient descent (SsGD) method under
sub-Weibull noises, as well as the high-probability and in-expectation
convergence of clipped SsGD under the $p$-BCM noises. Both analyses are
conducted in the context of weakly convex optimization. For weakly convex
objectives that may be non-convex and non-smooth, our results demonstrate that
the theoretical dependence of vanilla SsGD on the failure probability and
number of iterations under sub-Weibull noises does not degrade compared to the
case of smooth objectives. Under $p$-BCM noises, our findings indicate that the
non-smoothness and non-convexity of weakly convex objectives do not impact the
theoretical dependence of clipped SGD on the failure probability relative to
the smooth case; however, the sample complexity we derived is worse than a
well-known lower bound for smooth optimization.

healthcare. However, many valuable applications for quadrupedal robots remain
overlooked. This research explores the effectiveness of three reinforcement
learning algorithms in training a simulated quadruped robot for autonomous
navigation and obstacle avoidance. The goal is to develop a robotic guide dog
simulation capable of path following and obstacle avoidance, with long-term
potential for real-world assistance to guide dogs and visually impaired
individuals. It also seeks to expand research into medical 'pets', including
robotic guide and alert dogs.
  A comparative analysis of thirteen related research papers shaped key
evaluation criteria, including collision detection, pathfinding algorithms,
sensor usage, robot type, and simulation platforms. The study focuses on sensor
inputs, collision frequency, reward signals, and learning progression to
determine which algorithm best supports robotic navigation in complex
environments.
  Custom-made environments were used to ensure fair evaluation of all three
algorithms under controlled conditions, allowing consistent data collection.
Results show that Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) outperformed Deep
Q-Network (DQN) and Q-learning across all metrics, particularly in average and
median steps to goal per episode.
  By analysing these results, this study contributes to robotic navigation, AI
and medical robotics, offering insights into the feasibility of AI-driven
quadruped mobility and its role in assistive robotics.

                                        <span>  Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm is a standard tool for black-box
optimization problems. The current state-of-the-art BO approach for permutation
spaces relies on the Mallows kernel-an $\Omega(n^2)$ representation that
explicitly enumerates every pairwise comparison. Inspired by the close
relationship between the Mallows kernel and pairwise comparison, we propose a
novel framework for generating kernel functions on permutation space based on
sorting algorithms. Within this framework, the Mallows kernel can be viewed as
a special instance derived from bubble sort. Further, we introduce the
\textbf{Merge Kernel} constructed from merge sort, which replaces the quadratic
complexity with $\Theta(n\log n)$ to achieve the lowest possible complexity.
The resulting feature vector is significantly shorter, can be computed in
linearithmic time, yet still efficiently captures meaningful permutation
distances. To boost robustness and right-invariance without sacrificing
compactness, we further incorporate three lightweight, task-agnostic
descriptors: (1) a shift histogram, which aggregates absolute element
displacements and supplies a global misplacement signal; (2) a split-pair line,
which encodes selected long-range comparisons by aligning elements across the
two halves of the whole permutation; and (3) sliding-window motifs, which
summarize local order patterns that influence near-neighbor objectives. Our
empirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed kernel consistently
outperforms the state-of-the-art Mallows kernel across various permutation
optimization benchmarks. Results confirm that the Merge Kernel provides a more
compact yet more effective solution for Bayesian optimization in permutation
space.

powerful cross-modal reasoning abilities, but also raised new safety concerns,
particularly when faced with adversarial multimodal inputs. To improve the
safety of MLLMs during inference, we introduce a modular and adaptive
inference-time intervention technology, AutoSteer, without requiring any
fine-tuning of the underlying model. AutoSteer incorporates three core
components: (1) a novel Safety Awareness Score (SAS) that automatically
identifies the most safety-relevant distinctions among the model's internal
layers; (2) an adaptive safety prober trained to estimate the likelihood of
toxic outputs from intermediate representations; and (3) a lightweight Refusal
Head that selectively intervenes to modulate generation when safety risks are
detected. Experiments on LLaVA-OV and Chameleon across diverse safety-critical
benchmarks demonstrate that AutoSteer significantly reduces the Attack Success
Rate (ASR) for textual, visual, and cross-modal threats, while maintaining
general abilities. These findings position AutoSteer as a practical,
interpretable, and effective framework for safer deployment of multimodal AI
systems.

strategically scheduling demand and generation bids in day-ahead markets. While
data-driven techniques have shown considerable prowess in achieving high
forecast accuracy in recent years, they rely heavily on the quality of input
covariates. In this paper, we investigate whether asynchronously published
prices as a result of differing gate closure times (GCTs) in some bidding zones
can improve forecasting accuracy in other markets with later GCTs. Using a
state-of-the-art ensemble of models, we show significant improvements of 22%
and 9% in forecast accuracy in the Belgian (BE) and Swedish bidding zones (SE3)
respectively, when including price data from interconnected markets with
earlier GCT (Germany-Luxembourg, Austria, and Switzerland). This improvement
holds for both general as well as extreme market conditions. Our analysis also
yields further important insights: frequent model recalibration is necessary
for maximum accuracy but comes at substantial additional computational costs,
and using data from more markets does not always lead to better performance - a
fact we delve deeper into with interpretability analysis of the forecast
models. Overall, these findings provide valuable guidance for market
participants and decision-makers aiming to optimize bidding strategies within
increasingly interconnected and volatile European energy markets.

efforts in the discovery of high-performance photovoltaic (PV) materials. Most
workflows rely on density functional theory (DFT) to estimate electronic and
optical properties relevant to solar energy conversion. Although more efficient
than laboratory-based methods, DFT calculations still entail substantial
computational and environmental costs. Machine learning (ML) models have
recently gained attention as surrogates for DFT, offering drastic reductions in
resource use with competitive predictive performance. In this study, we
reproduce a canonical DFT-based workflow to estimate the maximum efficiency
limit and progressively replace its components with ML surrogates. By
quantifying the CO$_2$ emissions associated with each computational strategy,
we evaluate the trade-offs between predictive efficacy and environmental cost.
Our results reveal multiple hybrid ML/DFT strategies that optimize different
points along the accuracy--emissions front. We find that direct prediction of
scalar quantities, such as maximum efficiency, is significantly more tractable
than using predicted absorption spectra as an intermediate step. Interestingly,
ML models trained on DFT data can outperform DFT workflows using alternative
exchange--correlation functionals in screening applications, highlighting the
consistency and utility of data-driven approaches. We also assess strategies to
improve ML-driven screening through expanded datasets and improved model
architectures tailored to PV-relevant features. This work provides a
quantitative framework for building low-emission, high-throughput discovery
pipelines.

                                        <span>  A central question in computer science and statistics is whether efficient
algorithms can achieve the information-theoretic limits of statistical
problems. Many computational-statistical tradeoffs have been shown under
average-case assumptions, but since statistical problems are average-case in
nature, it has been a challenge to base them on standard worst-case
assumptions.
  In PAC learning where such tradeoffs were first studied, the question is
whether computational efficiency can come at the cost of using more samples
than information-theoretically necessary. We base such tradeoffs on
$\mathsf{NP}$-hardness and obtain:
  $\circ$ Sharp computational-statistical tradeoffs assuming $\mathsf{NP}$
requires exponential time: For every polynomial $p(n)$, there is an $n$-variate
class $C$ with VC dimension $1$ such that the sample complexity of
time-efficiently learning $C$ is $\Theta(p(n))$.
  $\circ$ A characterization of $\mathsf{RP}$ vs. $\mathsf{NP}$ in terms of
learning: $\mathsf{RP} = \mathsf{NP}$ iff every $\mathsf{NP}$-enumerable class
is learnable with $O(\mathrm{VCdim}(C))$ samples in polynomial time. The
forward implication has been known since (Pitt and Valiant, 1988); we prove the
reverse implication.
  Notably, all our lower bounds hold against improper learners. These are the
first $\mathsf{NP}$-hardness results for improperly learning a subclass of
polynomial-size circuits, circumventing formal barriers of Applebaum, Barak,
and Xiao (2008).

                                        <span>  Recent years have witnessed a growing interest for time series foundation
models, with a strong emphasis on the forecasting task. Yet, the crucial task
of out-of-domain imputation of missing values remains largely underexplored. We
propose a first step to fill this gap by leveraging implicit neural
representations (INRs). INRs model time series as continuous functions and
naturally handle various missing data scenarios and sampling rates. While they
have shown strong performance within specific distributions, they struggle
under distribution shifts. To address this, we introduce MoTM (Mixture of
Timeflow Models), a step toward a foundation model for time series imputation.
Building on the idea that a new time series is a mixture of previously seen
patterns, MoTM combines a basis of INRs, each trained independently on a
distinct family of time series, with a ridge regressor that adapts to the
observed context at inference. We demonstrate robust in-domain and
out-of-domain generalization across diverse imputation scenarios (e.g., block
and pointwise missingness, variable sampling rates), paving the way for
adaptable foundation imputation models.

                                        <span>  The Sliced Gromov-Wasserstein (SGW) distance, aiming to relieve the
computational cost of solving a non-convex quadratic program that is the
Gromov-Wasserstein distance, utilizes projecting directions sampled uniformly
from unit hyperspheres. This slicing mechanism incurs unnecessary computational
costs due to uninformative directions, which also affects the representative
power of the distance. However, finding a more appropriate distribution over
the projecting directions (slicing distribution) is often an optimization
problem in itself that comes with its own computational cost. In addition, with
more intricate distributions, the sampling itself may be expensive. As a
remedy, we propose an optimization-free slicing distribution that provides fast
sampling for the Monte Carlo approximation. We do so by introducing the
Relation-Aware Projecting Direction (RAPD), effectively capturing the pairwise
association of each of two pairs of random vectors, each following their
ambient law. This enables us to derive the Relation-Aware Slicing Distribution
(RASD), a location-scale law corresponding to sampled RAPDs. Finally, we
introduce the RASGW distance and its variants, e.g., IWRASGW (Importance
Weighted RASGW), which overcome the shortcomings experienced by SGW. We
theoretically analyze its properties and substantiate its empirical prowess
using extensive experiments on various alignment tasks.

formulation of the optimal transport problem, which arises in modern
applications ranging from fluid dynamics to robot swarm control. When the
transport cost is the squared Euclidean distance, Brenier's theorem guarantees
that the unique optimal map is the gradient of a convex function, namely a
monotone gradient map, and it satisfies a Monge-Amp\`ere equation. In
[arXiv:2301.10862] [arXiv:2404.07361], we proposed Monotone Gradient Networks
(mGradNets), neural networks that directly parameterize the space of monotone
gradient maps. In this work, we leverage mGradNets to directly learn the
optimal transport mapping by minimizing a training loss function defined using
the Monge-Amp\`ere equation. We empirically show that the structural bias of
mGradNets facilitates the learning of optimal transport maps and employ our
method for a robot swarm control problem.

from both theoretical and empirical successes. However, the existing
representation learning mainly induced from model learning aspects, misaligning
with our RL tasks. This work introduces Spectral Bellman Representation, a
novel framework derived from the Inherent Bellman Error (IBE) condition, which
aligns with the fundamental structure of Bellman updates across a space of
possible value functions, therefore, directly towards value-based RL. Our key
insight is the discovery of a fundamental spectral relationship: under the
zero-IBE condition, the transformation of a distribution of value functions by
the Bellman operator is intrinsically linked to the feature covariance
structure. This spectral connection yields a new, theoretically-grounded
objective for learning state-action features that inherently capture this
Bellman-aligned covariance. Our method requires a simple modification to
existing algorithms. We demonstrate that our learned representations enable
structured exploration, by aligning feature covariance with Bellman dynamics,
and improve overall performance, particularly in challenging hard-exploration
and long-horizon credit assignment tasks. Our framework naturally extends to
powerful multi-step Bellman operators, further broadening its impact. Spectral
Bellman Representation offers a principled and effective path toward learning
more powerful and structurally sound representations for value-based
reinforcement learning.

voice-enabled smart devices, and audio conferencing. However, audio
manipulations, such as deepfakes, pose significant risks by enabling the spread
of misinformation. Our empirical analysis reveals that existing methods for
detecting deepfake audio are often vulnerable to anti-forensic (AF) attacks,
particularly those attacked using generative adversarial networks. In this
article, we propose a novel collaborative learning method called SHIELD to
defend against generative AF attacks. To expose AF signatures, we integrate an
auxiliary generative model, called the defense (DF) generative model, which
facilitates collaborative learning by combining input and output. Furthermore,
we design a triplet model to capture correlations for real and AF attacked
audios with real-generated and attacked-generated audios using auxiliary
generative models. The proposed SHIELD strengthens the defense against
generative AF attacks and achieves robust performance across various generative
models. The proposed AF significantly reduces the average detection accuracy
from 95.49% to 59.77% for ASVspoof2019, from 99.44% to 38.45% for In-the-Wild,
and from 98.41% to 51.18% for HalfTruth for three different generative models.
The proposed SHIELD mechanism is robust against AF attacks and achieves an
average accuracy of 98.13%, 98.58%, and 99.57% in match, and 98.78%, 98.62%,
and 98.85% in mismatch settings for the ASVspoof2019, In-the-Wild, and
HalfTruth datasets, respectively.

                                        <span>  Existing world models for autonomous driving struggle with long-horizon
generation and generalization to challenging scenarios. In this work, we
develop a model using simple design choices, and without additional supervision
or sensors, such as maps, depth, or multiple cameras. We show that our model
yields state-of-the-art performance, despite having only 469M parameters and
being trained on 280h of video data. It particularly stands out in difficult
scenarios like turning maneuvers and urban traffic. We test whether discrete
token models possibly have advantages over continuous models based on flow
matching. To this end, we set up a hybrid tokenizer that is compatible with
both approaches and allows for a side-by-side comparison. Our study concludes
in favor of the continuous autoregressive model, which is less brittle on
individual design choices and more powerful than the model built on discrete
tokens. Code, models and qualitative results are publicly available at

                                        <span>  In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), alignment has emerged as a
fundamental yet challenging problem in the pursuit of more reliable,
controllable, and capable machine intelligence. The recent success of reasoning
models and conversational AI systems has underscored the critical role of
reinforcement learning (RL) in enhancing these systems, driving increased
research interest at the intersection of RL and LLM alignment. This paper
provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in LLM alignment through the
lens of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), emphasizing the distinctions
between RL techniques employed in LLM alignment and those in conventional RL
tasks. In particular, we highlight the necessity of constructing neural reward
models from human data and discuss the formal and practical implications of
this paradigm shift. We begin by introducing fundamental concepts in RL to
provide a foundation for readers unfamiliar with the field. We then examine
recent advances in this research agenda, discussing key challenges and
opportunities in conducting IRL for LLM alignment. Beyond methodological
considerations, we explore practical aspects, including datasets, benchmarks,
evaluation metrics, infrastructure, and computationally efficient training and
inference techniques. Finally, we draw insights from the literature on
sparse-reward RL to identify open questions and potential research directions.
By synthesizing findings from diverse studies, we aim to provide a structured
and critical overview of the field, highlight unresolved challenges, and
outline promising future directions for improving LLM alignment through RL and
IRL techniques.

availability of open-source datasets containing diverse nonverbal vocalizations
(NVs). In this work, we introduce NonverbalTTS (NVTTS), a 17-hour open-access

categories. The dataset is derived from popular sources, VoxCeleb and Expresso,
using automated detection followed by human validation. We propose a
comprehensive pipeline that integrates automatic speech recognition (ASR), NV
tagging, emotion classification, and a fusion algorithm to merge transcriptions
from multiple annotators. Fine-tuning open-source text-to-speech (TTS) models
on the NVTTS dataset achieves parity with closed-source systems such as
CosyVoice2, as measured by both human evaluation and automatic metrics,
including speaker similarity and NV fidelity. By releasing NVTTS and its
accompanying annotation guidelines, we address a key bottleneck in expressive
TTS research. The dataset is available at

                                        <span>  Graph generation plays a pivotal role across numerous domains, including
molecular design and knowledge graph construction. Although existing methods
achieve considerable success in generating realistic graphs, their
interpretability remains limited, often obscuring the rationale behind
structural decisions. To address this challenge, we propose the Neural Graph
Topic Model (NGTM), a novel generative framework inspired by topic modeling in
natural language processing. NGTM represents graphs as mixtures of latent
topics, each defining a distribution over semantically meaningful
substructures, which facilitates explicit interpretability at both local and
global scales. The generation process transparently integrates these topic
distributions with a global structural variable, enabling clear semantic
tracing of each generated graph. Experiments demonstrate that NGTM achieves
competitive generation quality while uniquely enabling fine-grained control and
interpretability, allowing users to tune structural features or induce
biological properties through topic-level adjustments.

                                        <span>  Detecting tiny objects in remote sensing (RS) imagery has been a
long-standing challenge due to their extremely limited spatial information,
weak feature representations, and dense distributions across complex
backgrounds. Despite numerous efforts devoted, mainstream detectors still
underperform in such scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce RS-TinyNet, a
multi-stage feature fusion and enhancement model explicitly tailored for RS
tiny object detection in various RS scenarios. RS-TinyNet comes with two novel
designs: tiny object saliency modeling and feature integrity reconstruction.
Guided by these principles, we design three step-wise feature enhancement
modules. Among them, the multi-dimensional collaborative attention (MDCA)
module employs multi-dimensional attention to enhance the saliency of tiny
objects. Additionally, the auxiliary reversible branch (ARB) and a progressive
fusion detection head (PFDH) module are introduced to preserve information flow
and fuse multi-level features to bridge semantic gaps and retain structural
detail. Comprehensive experiments on public RS dataset AI-TOD show that our
RS-TinyNet surpasses existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) detectors by 4.0% AP and
6.5% AP75. Evaluations on DIOR benchmark dataset further validate its superior
detection performance in diverse RS scenarios. These results demonstrate that
the proposed multi-stage feature fusion strategy offers an effective and
practical solution for tiny object detection in complex RS environments.

                                        <span>  Fetal lung maturity is a critical indicator for predicting neonatal outcomes
and the need for post-natal intervention, especially for pregnancies affected
by fetal growth restriction. Intra-voxel incoherent motion analysis has shown
promising results for non-invasive assessment of fetal lung development, but
its reliance on manual segmentation is time-consuming, thus limiting its
clinical applicability. In this work, we present an automated lung maturity
evaluation pipeline for diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images that
consists of a deep learning-based fetal lung segmentation model and a
model-fitting lung maturity assessment. A 3D nnU-Net model was trained on
manually segmented images selected from the baseline frames of 4D
diffusion-weighted MRI scans. The segmentation model demonstrated robust
performance, yielding a mean Dice coefficient of 82.14%. Next, voxel-wise model
fitting was performed based on both the nnU-Net-predicted and manual lung
segmentations to quantify IVIM parameters reflecting tissue microstructure and
perfusion. The results suggested no differences between the two. Our work shows
that a fully automated pipeline is possible for supporting fetal lung maturity
assessment and clinical decision-making.

                                        <span>  We introduce SemCSE, an unsupervised method for learning semantic embeddings
of scientific texts. Building on recent advances in contrastive learning for
text embeddings, our approach leverages LLM-generated summaries of scientific
abstracts to train a model that positions semantically related summaries closer
together in the embedding space. This resulting objective ensures that the
model captures the true semantic content of a text, in contrast to traditional
citation-based approaches that do not necessarily reflect semantic similarity.
To validate this, we propose a novel benchmark designed to assess a model's
ability to understand and encode the semantic content of scientific texts,
demonstrating that our method enforces a stronger semantic separation within
the embedding space. Additionally, we evaluate SemCSE on the comprehensive
SciRepEval benchmark for scientific text embeddings, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance among models of its size, thus highlighting the
benefits of a semantically focused training approach.

                                        <span>  Data classification without access to labeled samples remains a challenging
problem. It usually depends on an appropriately chosen distance between
features, a topic addressed in metric learning. Recently, Huizing, Cantini and
Peyr\'e proposed to simultaneously learn optimal transport (OT) cost matrices
between samples and features of the dataset. This leads to the task of finding
positive eigenvectors of a certain nonlinear function that maps cost matrices
to OT distances. Having this basic idea in mind, we consider both the
algorithmic and the modeling part of unsupervised metric learning. First, we
examine appropriate algorithms and their convergence. In particular, we propose
to use the stochastic random function iteration algorithm and prove that it
converges linearly for our setting, although our operators are not
paracontractive as it was required for convergence so far. Second, we ask the
natural question if the OT distance can be replaced by other distances. We show
how Mahalanobis-like distances fit into our considerations. Further, we examine
an approach via graph Laplacians. In contrast to the previous settings, we have
just to deal with linear functions in the wanted matrices here, so that simple
algorithms from linear algebra can be applied.

                                        <span>  Electroencephalography (EEG) is a fundamental modality for cognitive state
monitoring in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, it is highly
susceptible to intrinsic signal errors and human-induced labeling errors, which
lead to label noise and ultimately degrade model performance. To enhance EEG
learning, multimodal knowledge distillation (KD) has been explored to transfer
knowledge from visual models with rich representations to EEG-based models.
Nevertheless, KD faces two key challenges: modality gap and soft label
misalignment. The former arises from the heterogeneous nature of EEG and visual
feature spaces, while the latter stems from label inconsistencies that create
discrepancies between ground truth labels and distillation targets. This paper
addresses semantic uncertainty caused by ambiguous features and weakly defined
labels. We propose a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that
mitigates both modality and label inconsistencies. It aligns feature semantics
through a prototype-based similarity module and introduces a task-specific
distillation head to resolve label-induced inconsistency in supervision.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves EEG-based emotion
regression and classification performance, outperforming both unimodal and
multimodal baselines on a public multimodal dataset. These findings highlight
the potential of our framework for BCI applications.

agnostic, and guaranteed to converge. We propose MULTIDIMENSIONAL PROBLEM
AGNOSTIC EXPLAINABLE AI (MUPAX), a deterministic, model agnostic explainability
technique, with guaranteed convergency. MUPAX measure theoretic formulation
gives principled feature importance attribution through structured perturbation
analysis that discovers inherent input patterns and eliminates spurious
relationships. We evaluate MUPAX on an extensive range of data modalities and
tasks: audio classification (1D), image classification (2D), volumetric medical
image analysis (3D), and anatomical landmark detection, demonstrating dimension
agnostic effectiveness. The rigorous convergence guarantees extend to any loss
function and arbitrary dimensions, making MUPAX applicable to virtually any
problem context for AI. By contrast with other XAI methods that typically
decrease performance when masking, MUPAX not only preserves but actually
enhances model accuracy by capturing only the most important patterns of the
original data. Extensive benchmarking against the state of the XAI art
demonstrates MUPAX ability to generate precise, consistent and understandable
explanations, a crucial step towards explainable and trustworthy AI systems.
The source code will be released upon publication.

                                        <span>  Designing effective neural networks is a cornerstone of deep learning, and
Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful tool for automating
this process. Among the existing NAS approaches, Differentiable Architecture
Search (DARTS) has gained prominence for its efficiency and ease of use,
inspiring numerous advancements. Since the rise of Vision Transformers (ViT),
researchers have applied NAS to explore ViT architectures, often focusing on
macro-level search spaces and relying on discrete methods like evolutionary
algorithms. While these methods ensure reliability, they face challenges in
discovering innovative architectural designs, demand extensive computational
resources, and are time-intensive. To address these limitations, we introduce
Differentiable Architecture Search for Vision Transformer (DASViT), which
bridges the gap in differentiable search for ViTs and uncovers novel designs.
Experiments show that DASViT delivers architectures that break traditional
Transformer encoder designs, outperform ViT-B/16 on multiple datasets, and
achieve superior efficiency with fewer parameters and FLOPs.

vertices. This corresponds to learning a graph's labeling, knowing its
structure and label set. We consider classes where permutations move only
finitely many vertices. Our main result shows that PAC learnability of all such
finite-support copies implies online learnability of the full isomorphism type
of G, and is equivalent to the condition of automorphic triviality. We also
characterize graphs where copies induced by swapping two vertices are not
learnable, using a relaxation of the extension property of the infinite random
graph. Finally, we show that, for all G and k>2, learnability for k-vertex
permutations is equivalent to that for 2-vertex permutations, yielding a
four-class partition of infinite graphs, whose complexity we also determine
using tools coming from both descriptive set theory and computability theory.

encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only designs, raise a crucial

existing models are often tightly coupled with various time-series-specific
designs, making it difficult to isolate the impact of the architecture itself.

enabling clearer and more unified comparisons of Transformer architectures. Our
taxonomy considers key aspects such as attention mechanisms, forecasting
aggregations, forecasting paradigms, and normalization layers. Through
extensive experiments, we uncover several key insights: bi-directional
attention with joint-attention is most effective; more complete forecasting
aggregation improves performance; and the direct-mapping paradigm outperforms
autoregressive approaches. Furthermore, our combined model, utilizing optimal
architectural choices, consistently outperforms several existing models,
reinforcing the validity of our conclusions. We hope these findings offer
valuable guidance for future research on Transformer architectural designs in
LTSF. Our code is available at https://github.com/HALF111/TSF_architecture.

services. Monitoring these regions at scale using satellite imagery and machine
learning is promising, but current methods often lack interpretability and
uncertainty-awareness, and do not address how uncertainty affects naturalness
assessment. In contrast, we propose Confidence-Filtered Relevance (CFR), a
data-centric framework that combines LRP Attention Rollout with Deep
Deterministic Uncertainty (DDU) estimation to analyze how model uncertainty
influences the interpretability of relevance heatmaps. CFR partitions the
dataset into subsets based on uncertainty thresholds, enabling systematic
analysis of how uncertainty shapes the explanations of naturalness in satellite
imagery. Applied to the AnthroProtect dataset, CFR assigned higher relevance to
shrublands, forests, and wetlands, aligning with other research on naturalness
assessment. Moreover, our analysis shows that as uncertainty increases, the
interpretability of these relevance heatmaps declines and their entropy grows,
indicating less selective and more ambiguous attributions. CFR provides a
data-centric approach to assess the relevance of patterns to naturalness in
satellite imagery based on their associated certainty.

                                        <span>  Symbolic regression is the machine learning method for learning functions
from data. After a brief overview of the symbolic regression landscape, I will
describe the two main challenges that traditional algorithms face: they have an
unknown (and likely significant) probability of failing to find any given good
function, and they suffer from ambiguity and poorly-justified assumptions in
their function-selection procedure. To address these I propose an exhaustive
search and model selection by the minimum description length principle, which
allows accuracy and complexity to be directly traded off by measuring each in
units of information. I showcase the resulting publicly available Exhaustive
Symbolic Regression algorithm on three open problems in astrophysics: the
expansion history of the universe, the effective behaviour of gravity in
galaxies and the potential of the inflaton field. In each case the algorithm
identifies many functions superior to the literature standards. This general
purpose methodology should find widespread utility in science and beyond.

task even in parametric models, since parameter estimation in itself is not
sufficient to predict on partially observed inputs. Several works study
prediction in linear models. In this paper, we focus on logistic models, which
present their own difficulties. From a theoretical perspective, we prove that a
Pattern-by-Pattern strategy (PbP), which learns one logistic model per
missingness pattern, accurately approximates Bayes probabilities in various
missing data scenarios (MCAR, MAR and MNAR). Empirically, we thoroughly compare
various methods (constant and iterative imputations, complete case analysis,
PbP, and an EM algorithm) across classification, probability estimation,
calibration, and parameter inference. Our analysis provides a comprehensive
view on the logistic regression with missing values. It reveals that mean
imputation can be used as baseline for low sample sizes, and improved
performance is obtained via nonlinear multiple iterative imputation techniques
with the labels (MICE.RF.Y). For large sample sizes, PbP is the best method for
Gaussian mixtures, and we recommend MICE.RF.Y in presence of nonlinear
features.

space launchers, we outline a first step toward developing an onboard fault
detection and diagnostic capability for the electrical system that controls the
engine valves. Unlike existing approaches in the literature, our solution is
designed to meet a broader range of key requirements. This includes estimating
confidence levels for predictions, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) cases,
and controlling false alarms. The proposed solution is based on a temporal
convolutional autoencoder to automatically extract low-dimensional features
from raw sensor data. Fault detection and diagnosis are respectively carried
out using a binary and a multiclass classifier trained on the autoencoder
latent and residual spaces. The classifiers are histogram-based gradient
boosting models calibrated to output probabilities that can be interpreted as
confidence levels. A relatively simple technique, based on inductive conformal
anomaly detection, is used to identify OOD data. We leverage other simple yet
effective techniques, such as cumulative sum control chart (CUSUM) to limit the
false alarms, and threshold moving to address class imbalance in fault
detection. The proposed framework is highly configurable and has been evaluated
on simulated data, covering both nominal and anomalous operational scenarios.
The results indicate that our solution is a promising first step, though
testing with real data will be necessary to ensure that it achieves the
required maturity level for operational use.

symbolic knowledge in the form of triples in a knowledge graph (KG) and their
feature vectors. Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models often represent
relations in a KG as geometric transformations. Most state-of-the-art (SOTA)
KGE models are derived from elementary geometric transformations (EGTs), such
as translation, scaling, rotation, and reflection, or their combinations. These
geometric transformations enable the models to effectively preserve specific
structural and relational patterns of the KG. However, the current use of EGTs
by KGEs remains insufficient without considering relation-specific
transformations. Although recent models attempted to address this problem by
ensembling SOTA baseline models in different ways, only a single or composite
version of geometric transformations are used by such baselines to represent
all the relations. In this paper, we propose a framework that evaluates how
well each relation fits with different geometric transformations. Based on this
ranking, the model can: (1) assign the best-matching transformation to each
relation, or (2) use majority voting to choose one transformation type to apply
across all relations. That is, the model learns a single relation-specific EGT
in low dimensional vector space through an attention mechanism. Furthermore, we
use the correlation between relations and EGTs, which are learned in a low
dimension, for relation embeddings in a high dimensional vector space. The
effectiveness of our models is demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations
on three benchmark KGs as well as a real-world financial KG, witnessing a
performance comparable to leading models

been greatly driven by training on ever-larger datasets with expensive compute
consumption. Sample selection as an alternative efficient paradigm plays an
important direction to accelerate the training process. However, recent
advances on sample selection either mostly rely on an oracle model to offline
select a high-quality coreset, which is limited in the cold-start scenarios, or
focus on online selection based on real-time model predictions, which has not
sufficiently or efficiently considered the noisy correspondence. To address
this dilemma, we propose a novel Differential-Informed Sample Selection
(DISSect) method, which accurately and efficiently discriminates the noisy
correspondence for training acceleration. Specifically, we rethink the impact
of noisy correspondence on contrastive learning and propose that the
differential between the predicted correlation of the current model and that of
a historical model is more informative to characterize sample quality. Based on
this, we construct a robust differential-based sample selection and analyze its
theoretical insights. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and
various downstream tasks demonstrate the consistent superiority of DISSect over
current state-of-the-art methods. Source code is available at:

                                        <span>  Sparse Autoencoders have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting the
internal representations of Large Language Models, yet they often fail to
capture domain-specific features not prevalent in their training corpora. This
paper introduces a residual learning approach that addresses this feature
blindness without requiring complete retraining. We propose training a
secondary SAE specifically to model the reconstruction error of a pretrained
SAE on domain-specific texts, effectively capturing features missed by the
primary model. By summing the outputs of both models during inference, we
demonstrate significant improvements in both LLM cross-entropy and explained
variance metrics across multiple specialized domains. Our experiments show that
this method efficiently incorporates new domain knowledge into existing SAEs
while maintaining their performance on general tasks. This approach enables
researchers to selectively enhance SAE interpretability for specific domains of
interest, opening new possibilities for targeted mechanistic interpretability
of LLMs.

Transfomers motivate reusing the vast library of already trained
state-of-the-art networks. However, their latency, high computational costs and
memory demands pose significant challenges for deployment, especially on
resource-constrained hardware. While structured pruning methods can reduce
these factors, they often require costly retraining, sometimes for up to
hundreds of epochs, or even training from scratch to recover the lost accuracy
resulting from the structural modifications. Maintaining the provided
performance of trained models after structured pruning and thereby avoiding
extensive retraining remains a challenge. To solve this, we introduce
Variance-Based Pruning, a simple and structured one-shot pruning technique for
efficiently compressing networks, with minimal finetuning. Our approach first
gathers activation statistics, which are used to select neurons for pruning.
Simultaneously the mean activations are integrated back into the model to
preserve a high degree of performance. On ImageNet-1k recognition tasks, we
demonstrate that directly after pruning DeiT-Base retains over 70% of its
original performance and requires only 10 epochs of fine-tuning to regain 99%
of the original accuracy while simultaneously reducing MACs by 35% and model
size by 36%, thus speeding up the model by 1.44x.

                                        <span>  Fairness has emerged as one of the key challenges in federated learning. In
horizontal federated settings, data heterogeneity often leads to substantial
performance disparities across clients, raising concerns about equitable model
behavior. To address this issue, we propose FedGA, a fairness-aware federated
learning algorithm. We first employ the Gini coefficient to measure the
performance disparity among clients. Based on this, we establish a relationship
between the Gini coefficient $G$ and the update scale of the global model
${U_s}$, and use this relationship to adaptively determine the timing of
fairness intervention. Subsequently, we dynamically adjust the aggregation
weights according to the system's real-time fairness status, enabling the
global model to better incorporate information from clients with relatively
poor performance.We conduct extensive experiments on the Office-Caltech-10,
CIFAR-10, and Synthetic datasets. The results show that FedGA effectively
improves fairness metrics such as variance and the Gini coefficient, while
maintaining strong overall performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach.

                                        <span>  Federated Learning has gained increasing attention for its ability to enable
multiple nodes to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing
their raw data. At the same time, Generative AI -- particularly Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) -- have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of domains, such as healthcare, security, and Image Generation. However,
training generative models typically requires large datasets and significant
computational resources, which are often unavailable in real-world settings.
Acquiring such resources can be costly and inefficient, especially when many
underutilized devices -- such as IoT devices and edge devices -- with varying
capabilities remain idle. Moreover, obtaining large datasets is challenging due
to privacy concerns and copyright restrictions, as most devices are unwilling
to share their data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach
for decentralized GAN training that enables the utilization of distributed data
and underutilized, low-capability devices while not sharing data in its raw
form. Our approach is designed to tackle key challenges in decentralized
environments, combining KLD-weighted Clustered Federated Learning to address
the issues of data heterogeneity and multi-domain datasets, with Heterogeneous
U-Shaped split learning to tackle the challenge of device heterogeneity under
strict data sharing constraints -- ensuring that no labels or raw data, whether
real or synthetic, are ever shared between nodes. Experimental results shows
that our approach demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across
key performance metrics, where it achieves 1.1x -- 2.2x higher image generation
scores, an average 10% boost in classification metrics (up to 50% in
multi-domain non-IID settings), in much lower latency compared to several
benchmarks. Find our code at https://github.com/youssefga28/HuSCF-GAN.

health monitoring using drive-by vibration response signals. Recognizing the
importance of spectral and temporal information, we introduce the
WaveletInception-BiLSTM network. The WaveletInception feature extractor
utilizes a Learnable Wavelet Packet Transform (LWPT) as the stem for extracting
vibration signal features, incorporating spectral information in the early
network layers. This is followed by 1D Inception networks that extract
multi-scale, high-level features at deeper layers. The extracted vibration
signal features are then integrated with operational conditions via a Long
Short-term Memory (LSTM) layer. The resulting feature extraction network
effectively analyzes drive-by vibration signals across various measurement
speeds without preprocessing and uses LSTM to capture interrelated temporal
dependencies among different modes of information and to create feature vectors
for health condition estimation. The estimator head is designed with a
sequential modeling architecture using bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) networks,
capturing bi-directional temporal relationships from drive-by measurements.
This architecture allows for a high-resolution, beam-level assessment of
infrastructure health conditions. A case study focusing on railway track
stiffness estimation with simulated drive-by vibration signals shows that the
model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in estimating railway
ballast and railpad stiffness parameters. Results underscore the potential of
this approach for accurate, localized, and fully automated drive-by
infrastructure health monitoring.

economic, and social disruptions. Rapid global transmission overwhelmed
healthcare systems, resulting in high infection rates, hospitalisations, and
fatalities. To minimise the spread, governments implemented several
non-pharmaceutical interventions like lockdowns and travel restrictions. While
effective in controlling transmission, these measures also posed significant
economic and societal challenges. Although the WHO declared COVID-19 no longer
a global health emergency in May 2023, its impact persists, shaping public
health strategies. The vast amount of data collected during the pandemic offers
valuable insights into disease dynamics, transmission, and intervention
effectiveness. Leveraging these insights can improve forecasting models,
enhancing preparedness and response to future outbreaks while mitigating their
social and economic impact. This paper presents a large-scale case study on
COVID-19 forecasting in Cyprus, utilising a two-year dataset that integrates
epidemiological data, vaccination records, policy measures, and weather
conditions. We analyse infection trends, assess forecasting performance, and
examine the influence of external factors on disease dynamics. The insights
gained contribute to improved pandemic preparedness and response strategies.

                                        <span>  Wrist pathologies are frequently observed, particularly among children who
constitute the majority of fracture cases. However, diagnosing these conditions
is time-consuming and requires specialized expertise. Computer vision presents
a promising avenue, contingent upon the availability of extensive datasets, a
notable challenge in medical imaging. Therefore, reliance solely on one
modality, such as images, proves inadequate, especially in an era of diverse
and plentiful data types. In this study, we employ a multifaceted approach to
address the challenge of recognizing wrist pathologies using an extremely
limited dataset. Initially, we approach the problem as a fine-grained
recognition task, aiming to identify subtle X-ray pathologies that conventional
CNNs overlook. Secondly, we enhance network performance by fusing patient
metadata with X-ray images. Thirdly, rather than pre-training on a
coarse-grained dataset like ImageNet, we utilize weights trained on a
fine-grained dataset. While metadata integration has been used in other medical
domains, this is a novel application for wrist pathologies. Our results show
that a fine-grained strategy and metadata integration improve diagnostic
accuracy by 2% with a limited dataset and by over 10% with a larger
fracture-focused dataset.

                                        <span>  Reservoir computing has been successfully applied to graphs as a
preprocessing method to improve the training efficiency of Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). However, a common issue that arises when repeatedly applying
layer operators on graphs is over-smoothing, which consists in the convergence
of graph signals toward low-frequency components of the graph Laplacian. This
work revisits the definition of the reservoir in the Multiresolution Reservoir
Graph Neural Network (MRGNN), a spectral reservoir model, and proposes a
variant based on a Fairing algorithm originally introduced in the field of
surface design in computer graphics. This algorithm provides a pass-band
spectral filter that allows smoothing without shrinkage, and it can be adapted
to the graph setting through the Laplacian operator. Given its spectral
formulation, this method naturally connects to GNN architectures for tasks
where smoothing, when properly controlled, can be beneficial,such as graph
classification. The core contribution of the paper lies in the theoretical
analysis of the algorithm from a random walks perspective. In particular, it
shows how tuning the spectral coefficients can be interpreted as modulating the
contribution of redundant random walks. Exploratory experiments based on the
MRGNN architecture illustrate the potential of this approach and suggest
promising directions for future research.

                                        <span>  Regularization is essential in deformable image registration (DIR) to ensure
that the estimated Deformation Vector Field (DVF) remains smooth, physically
plausible, and anatomically consistent. However, fine-tuning regularization
parameters in learning-based DIR frameworks is computationally expensive, often
requiring multiple training iterations. To address this, we propose cIDI, a
novel DIR framework based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that
conditions the registration process on regularization hyperparameters. Unlike
conventional methods that require retraining for each regularization
hyperparameter setting, cIDIR is trained over a prior distribution of these
hyperparameters, then optimized over the regularization hyperparameters by
using the segmentations masks as an observation. Additionally, cIDIR models a
continuous and differentiable DVF, enabling seamless integration of advanced
regularization techniques via automatic differentiation. Evaluated on the
DIR-LAB dataset, $\operatorname{cIDIR}$ achieves high accuracy and robustness
across the dataset.

which is especially important in healthcare applications where decisions often
carry significant consequences. Mechanistic interpretability, particularly
through the use of sparse autoencoders (SAEs), offers a promising approach for
uncovering human-interpretable features within large transformer-based models.
In this study, we apply Matryoshka-SAE to the radiology-specialised multimodal
large language model, MAIRA-2, to interpret its internal representations. Using
large-scale automated interpretability of the SAE features, we identify a range
of clinically relevant concepts - including medical devices (e.g., line and
tube placements, pacemaker presence), pathologies such as pleural effusion and
cardiomegaly, longitudinal changes and textual features. We further examine the
influence of these features on model behaviour through steering, demonstrating
directional control over generations with mixed success. Our results reveal
practical and methodological challenges, yet they offer initial insights into
the internal concepts learned by MAIRA-2 - marking a step toward deeper
mechanistic understanding and interpretability of a radiology-adapted
multimodal large language model, and paving the way for improved model
transparency. We release the trained SAEs and interpretations:

                                        <span>  In reasoning chains generated by large language models (LLMs), initial errors
often propagate and undermine the reliability of the final conclusion. Current
LLM-based error detection methods often fail to detect propagated errors
because they do not properly account for how earlier errors might corrupt
judgments of downstream reasoning. To better detect such propagated errors, we
introduce Autoregressive Reasoning Entailment Stability (ARES), a novel
probabilistic framework that prevents error propagation by judging each claim
based only on previously-assessed sound premises. This inductive method yields
a nuanced score for each step and provides certified statistical guarantees of
its soundness, rather than a brittle binary label. ARES achieves
state-of-the-art performance across four benchmarks (72.1% Macro-F1, +8.2
points) and demonstrates superior robustness on very long synthetic reasoning
chains, where it excels at detecting propagated errors (90.3% F1, +27.6
points).

for planning, optimization, and inference. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
algorithms form the computational backbone of this emerging branch of machine
learning. Unfortunately, the high computational cost limits their feasibility
for large-scale problems and real-world applications, and the existing MCMC
acceleration solutions are either limited in hardware flexibility or fail to
maintain efficiency at the system level across a variety of end-to-end
applications. This paper introduces \textbf{MC$^2$A}, an algorithm-hardware
co-design framework, enabling efficient and flexible optimization for MCMC
acceleration. Firstly, \textbf{MC$^2$A} analyzes the MCMC workload diversity
through an extension of the processor performance roofline model with a 3rd
dimension to derive the optimal balance between the compute, sampling and
memory parameters. Secondly, \textbf{MC$^2$A} proposes a parametrized hardware
accelerator architecture with flexible and efficient support of MCMC kernels
with a pipeline of ISA-programmable tree-structured processing units,
reconfigurable samplers and a crossbar interconnect to support irregular
access. Thirdly, the core of \textbf{MC$^2$A} is powered by a novel Gumbel
sampler that eliminates exponential and normalization operations. In the
end-to-end case study, \textbf{MC$^2$A} achieves an overall {$307.6\times$,
$1.4\times$, $2.0\times$, $84.2\times$} speedup compared to the CPU, GPU, TPU
and state-of-the-art MCMC accelerator. Evaluated on various representative MCMC
workloads, this work demonstrates and exploits the feasibility of general
hardware acceleration to popularize MCMC-based solutions in diverse application
domains.

                                        <span>  Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation but
come with significant computational costs, posing challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Recent post-training quantization (PTQ)
methods have attempted to mitigate this issue by focusing on the iterative
nature of diffusion models. However, these approaches often overlook outliers,
leading to degraded performance at low bit-widths. In this paper, we propose a
DMQ which combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise
Power-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to effectively address these challenges. Learned
Equivalent Scaling optimizes channel-wise scaling factors to redistribute
quantization difficulty between weights and activations, reducing overall
quantization error. Recognizing that early denoising steps, despite having
small quantization errors, crucially impact the final output due to error
accumulation, we incorporate an adaptive timestep weighting scheme to
prioritize these critical steps during learning. Furthermore, identifying that
layers such as skip connections exhibit high inter-channel variance, we
introduce channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations. To ensure robust
selection of PTS factors even with small calibration set, we introduce a voting
algorithm that enhances reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing works, especially at low bit-widths
such as W4A6 (4-bit weight, 6-bit activation) and W4A8, maintaining high image
generation quality and model stability. The code is available at

                                        <span>  This paper introduces two novel modifications to the Differentiable Automatic
Post-editing Optimization (DAPO) algorithm, approached from a mixed-policy
perspective. Standard policy gradient methods can suffer from instability and
sample inefficiency, particularly in sparse reward settings. To address this,
we first propose a method that incorporates a pre-trained, stable guiding
policy ($\piphi$) to provide off-policy experience, thereby regularizing the
training of the target policy ($\pion$). This approach improves training
stability and convergence speed by adaptively adjusting the learning step size.
Secondly, we extend this idea to re-utilize zero-reward samples, which are
often discarded by dynamic sampling strategies like DAPO's. By treating these
samples as a distinct batch guided by the expert policy, we further enhance
sample efficiency. We provide a theoretical analysis for both methods,
demonstrating that their objective functions converge to the optimal solution
within the established theoretical framework of reinforcement learning. The
proposed mixed-policy framework effectively balances exploration and
exploitation, promising more stable and efficient policy optimization.

                                        <span>  The general trace reconstruction problem seeks to recover an original
sequence from its noisy copies independently corrupted by deletions,
insertions, and substitutions. This problem arises in applications such as DNA
data storage, a promising storage medium due to its high information density
and longevity. However, errors introduced during DNA synthesis, storage, and
sequencing require correction through algorithms and codes, with trace
reconstruction often used as part of the data retrieval process. In this work,
we propose TReconLM, which leverages language models trained on next-token
prediction for trace reconstruction. We pretrain language models on synthetic
data and fine-tune on real-world data to adapt to technology-specific error
patterns. TReconLM outperforms state-of-the-art trace reconstruction
algorithms, including prior deep learning approaches, recovering a
substantially higher fraction of sequences without error.

                                        <span>  Recent advancements in machine learning have emphasized the need for
transparency in model predictions, particularly as interpretability diminishes
when using increasingly complex architectures. In this paper, we propose
leveraging prediction uncertainty as a complementary approach to classical
explainability methods. Specifically, we distinguish between aleatoric
(data-related) and epistemic (model-related) uncertainty to guide the selection
of appropriate explanations. Epistemic uncertainty serves as a rejection
criterion for unreliable explanations and, in itself, provides insight into
insufficient training (a new form of explanation). Aleatoric uncertainty
informs the choice between feature-importance explanations and counterfactual
explanations. This leverages a framework of explainability methods driven by
uncertainty quantification and disentanglement. Our experiments demonstrate the
impact of this uncertainty-aware approach on the robustness and attainability
of explanations in both traditional machine learning and deep learning
scenarios.

                                        <span>  Out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios in autonomous driving refer to situations
that deviate from the training domain, often leading to unexpected and
potentially hazardous behavior from planners that lack prior exposure to such
cases. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been introduced into
autonomous driving research for their promising generalization capabilities in
OOD settings. Early studies demonstrated that VLMs could recognize OOD
scenarios and generate user-level decisions such as "go straight" or "turn
right." However, a new challenge has emerged due to the misalignment between
the VLM's high-level decisions or visual reasoning expressed in language, and
the low-level predicted trajectories interpreted as actions. In this paper, we
propose LaViPlan, a framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize VLMs using planning-oriented metrics.
This approach addresses the vision-language-action misalignment observed in
existing VLMs fine-tuned via supervised learning, which can recognize driving
scenarios but often produce context-unaware decisions. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method improves situational awareness and decision-making
under OOD conditions, highlighting its potential to mitigate the misalignment
issue. This work introduces a promising post-training paradigm for VLM agents
in the context of autonomous driving.

auto-scaling and scheduling, with profound implications for operational
efficiency. Although Transformer-based forecasting models have demonstrated
remarkable success in general tasks, their computational efficiency often falls
short of the stringent requirements in large-scale cloud environments. Given
that most workload series exhibit complicated periodic patterns, addressing
these challenges in the frequency domain offers substantial advantages. To this
end, we propose Fremer, an efficient and effective deep forecasting model.
Fremer fulfills three critical requirements: it demonstrates superior
efficiency, outperforming most Transformer-based forecasting models; it
achieves exceptional accuracy, surpassing all state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in
workload forecasting; and it exhibits robust performance for multi-period
series. Furthermore, we collect and open-source four high-quality, open-source
workload datasets derived from ByteDance's cloud services, encompassing
workload data from thousands of computing instances. Extensive experiments on
both our proprietary datasets and public benchmarks demonstrate that Fremer
consistently outperforms baseline models, achieving average improvements of
5.5% in MSE, 4.7% in MAE, and 8.6% in SMAPE over SOTA models, while
simultaneously reducing parameter scale and computational costs. Additionally,
in a proactive auto-scaling test based on Kubernetes, Fremer improves average
latency by 18.78% and reduces resource consumption by 2.35%, underscoring its
practical efficacy in real-world applications.

applications such as credit scoring. Explanations help users unpack the reasons
behind their predictions, but are not always "high quality''. That is,
end-users may have difficulty interpreting or believing them, which can
complicate trust assessment and downstream decision-making. We argue that
classifiers should have the option to refuse handling inputs whose predictions
cannot be explained properly and introduce a framework for learning to reject
low-quality explanations (LtX) in which predictors are equipped with a rejector
that evaluates the quality of explanations. In this problem setting, the key
challenges are how to properly define and assess explanation quality and how to
design a suitable rejector. Focusing on popular attribution techniques, we
introduce ULER (User-centric Low-quality Explanation Rejector), which learns a
simple rejector from human ratings and per-feature relevance judgments to
mirror human judgments of explanation quality. Our experiments show that ULER
outperforms both state-of-the-art and explanation-aware learning to reject
strategies at LtX on eight classification and regression benchmarks and on a
new human-annotated dataset, which we will publicly release to support future
research.

robotic arms, is foundational for solving challenging tasks. Despite recent
progress in general-purpose manipulation, data scarcity and embodiment
heterogeneity remain serious obstacles to further scaling up in bimanual
settings. In this paper, we introduce VIdeo Diffusion for Action Reasoning
(VIDAR), a two-stage framework that leverages large-scale, diffusion-based
video pre-training and a novel masked inverse dynamics model for action
prediction. We pre-train the video diffusion model on 750K multi-view videos
from three real-world bimanual robot platforms, utilizing a unified observation
space that encodes robot, camera, task, and scene contexts. Our masked inverse
dynamics model learns masks to extract action-relevant information from
generated trajectories without requiring pixel-level labels, and the masks can
effectively generalize to unseen backgrounds. Our experiments demonstrate that
with only 20 minutes of human demonstrations on an unseen robot platform (only
1% of typical data requirements), VIDAR generalizes to unseen tasks and
backgrounds with strong semantic understanding, surpassing state-of-the-art
methods. Our findings highlight the potential of video foundation models,
coupled with masked action prediction, to enable scalable and generalizable
robotic manipulation in diverse real-world settings.

                                        <span>  Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to substantial
improvements in the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs), as measured by standard benchmarks. However, these gains often persist
even when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted
rewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true
reasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific
patterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective
and identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First,
\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test
problems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \emph{evaluation
fragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are
highly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning
consistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic
evaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting
fixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve
multiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across
structurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and
improving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular
benchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and
VAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for
RL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models,
with average declines of 48.0\% on AMC23 and 58.3\% on AIME24. These findings
suggest that many existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail
to generalize beyond specific numerical forms. Overall, VAR-MATH offers a
principled, contamination-resistant evaluation paradigm for mathematical
reasoning.

                                        <span>  This paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based method for microservice
resource scheduling and optimization, aiming to address issues such as uneven
resource allocation, high latency, and insufficient throughput in traditional
microservice architectures. In microservice systems, as the number of services
and the load increase, efficiently scheduling and allocating resources such as
computing power, memory, and storage becomes a critical research challenge. To
address this, the paper employs an intelligent scheduling algorithm based on
reinforcement learning. Through the interaction between the agent and the
environment, the resource allocation strategy is continuously optimized. In the
experiments, the paper considers different resource conditions and load
scenarios, evaluating the proposed method across multiple dimensions, including
response time, throughput, resource utilization, and cost efficiency. The
experimental results show that the reinforcement learning-based scheduling
method significantly improves system response speed and throughput under low
load and high concurrency conditions, while also optimizing resource
utilization and reducing energy consumption. Under multi-dimensional resource
conditions, the proposed method can consider multiple objectives and achieve
optimized resource scheduling. Compared to traditional static resource
allocation methods, the reinforcement learning model demonstrates stronger
adaptability and optimization capability. It can adjust resource allocation
strategies in real time, thereby maintaining good system performance in
dynamically changing load and resource environments.

data is a fundamental yet challenging ill-posed inverse problem. This work
introduces a unified Bayesian framework that models the system's impulse
response, $h(t, \tau)$, as a stochastic process. We decompose the response into
a posterior mean and a random fluctuation term, a formulation that provides a
principled approach for quantifying uncertainty and naturally defines a new,
useful system class we term Linear Time-Invariant in Expectation (LTIE). To
perform inference, we leverage modern machine learning techniques, including
Bayesian neural networks and Gaussian Processes, using scalable variational
inference. We demonstrate through a series of experiments that our framework
can robustly infer the properties of an LTI system from a single noisy
observation, show superior data efficiency compared to classical methods in a
simulated ambient noise tomography problem, and successfully track a
continuously varying LTV impulse response by using a structured Gaussian
Process prior. This work provides a flexible and robust methodology for
uncertainty-aware system identification in dynamic environments.

propose a novel and practical framework leveraging ear-EEG signals as a

extracts an original combination of temporal and spectral features from ear-EEG

demonstrate promising performance, with an average accuracy of 82\% in a

                                        <span>  Behavior Cloning (BC) on curated (or filtered) data is the predominant
paradigm for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models; as well as
for imitation learning of control policies. Here, we draw on a connection
between this successful strategy and the theory and practice of finding optimal
policies via Reinforcement Learning (RL). Building on existing literature, we
clarify that SFT can be understood as maximizing a lower bound on the RL
objective in a sparse reward setting. Giving support to its often observed good
performance. From this viewpoint, we realize that a small modification to SFT
leads to an importance weighted variant that behaves closer to training with RL
as it: i) optimizes a tighter bound to the RL objective and, ii) can improve
performance compared to SFT on curated data. We refer to this variant as
importance weighted supervised fine-tuning (iw-SFT). We show that it is easy to
implement and can be further generalized to training with quality scored data.
The resulting SFT variants are competitive with more advanced RL algorithms for
large language models and for training policies in continuous control tasks.
For example achieving 66.7% on the AIME 2024 dataset.

alternative to vision-based systems for human identification. However, person
identification through wireless signals, particularly without user motion,
remains largely unexplored. Most prior wireless-based approaches rely on
movement patterns, such as walking gait, to extract biometric cues. In
contrast, we propose a transformer-based method that identifies individuals
from Channel State Information (CSI) recorded while the subject remains
stationary. CSI captures fine-grained amplitude and phase distortions induced
by the unique interaction between the human body and the radio signal. To
support evaluation, we introduce a dataset acquired with ESP32 devices in a
controlled indoor environment, featuring six participants observed across
multiple orientations. A tailored preprocessing pipeline, including outlier
removal, smoothing, and phase calibration, enhances signal quality. Our
dual-branch transformer architecture processes amplitude and phase modalities
separately and achieves 99.82\% classification accuracy, outperforming
convolutional and multilayer perceptron baselines. These results demonstrate
the discriminative potential of CSI perturbations, highlighting their capacity
to encode biometric traits in a consistent manner. They further confirm the
viability of passive, device-free person identification using low-cost
commodity Wi-Fi hardware in real-world settings.

                                        <span>  The distribution closeness testing (DCT) assesses whether the distance
between a distribution pair is at least $\epsilon$-far. Existing DCT methods
mainly measure discrepancies between a distribution pair defined on discrete
one-dimensional spaces (e.g., using total variation), which limits their
applications to complex data (e.g., images). To extend DCT to more types of
data, a natural idea is to introduce maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a powerful
measurement of the distributional discrepancy between two complex
distributions, into DCT scenarios. However, we find that MMD's value can be the
same for many pairs of distributions that have different norms in the same
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), making MMD less informative when
assessing the closeness levels for multiple distribution pairs. To mitigate the
issue, we design a new measurement of distributional discrepancy, norm-adaptive
MMD (NAMMD), which scales MMD's value using the RKHS norms of distributions.
Based on the asymptotic distribution of NAMMD, we finally propose the
NAMMD-based DCT to assess the closeness levels of a distribution pair.
Theoretically, we prove that NAMMD-based DCT has higher test power compared to
MMD-based DCT, with bounded type-I error, which is also validated by extensive
experiments on many types of data (e.g., synthetic noise, real images).
Furthermore, we also apply the proposed NAMMD for addressing the two-sample
testing problem and find NAMMD-based two-sample test has higher test power than
the MMD-based two-sample test in both theory and experiments.

traditional methods like topic modelling often struggle to capture nuanced

in LLMs can compromise public health communication. To address these
limitations, we developed a tool (VaxPulse Query Corner) using the Retrieval

                                        <span>  The study of Neural Tangent Kernels (NTKs) in deep learning has drawn
increasing attention in recent years. NTKs typically actively change during
training and are related to feature learning. In parallel, recent work on
Gradient Descent (GD) has found a phenomenon called Edge of Stability (EoS), in
which the largest eigenvalue of the NTK oscillates around a value inversely
proportional to the step size. However, although follow-up works have explored
the underlying mechanism of such eigenvalue behavior in depth, the
understanding of the behavior of the NTK eigenvectors during EoS is still
missing. This paper examines the dynamics of NTK eigenvectors during EoS in
detail. Across different architectures, we observe that larger learning rates
cause the leading eigenvectors of the final NTK, as well as the full NTK
matrix, to have greater alignment with the training target. We then study the
underlying mechanism of this phenomenon and provide a theoretical analysis for
a two-layer linear network. Our study enhances the understanding of GD training
dynamics in deep learning.

occupy only a few dozen pixels, rendering detection and appearance-based
association unreliable. Building on the success of the MVA2023 SOD4SB
challenge, this paper introduces the SMOT4SB challenge, which leverages
temporal information to address limitations of single-frame detection. Our
three main contributions are: (1) the SMOT4SB dataset, consisting of 211 UAV
video sequences with 108,192 annotated frames under diverse real-world
conditions, designed to capture motion entanglement where both camera and
targets move freely in 3D; (2) SO-HOTA, a novel metric combining Dot Distance
with HOTA to mitigate the sensitivity of IoU-based metrics to small
displacements; and (3) a competitive MVA2025 challenge with 78 participants and
308 submissions, where the winning method achieved a 5.1x improvement over the
baseline. This work lays a foundation for advancing SMOT in UAV scenarios with
applications in bird strike avoidance, agriculture, fisheries, and ecological
monitoring.

real-world recordings is crucial. While supervised regression is the primary
method for speech enhancement, audio tokenization is emerging as a promising
alternative for a smooth integration with other modalities. However, research
on speech enhancement using discrete representations is still limited. Previous
work has mainly focused on semantic tokens, which tend to discard key acoustic
details such as speaker identity. Additionally, these studies typically employ
non-autoregressive models, assuming conditional independence of outputs and
overlooking the potential improvements offered by autoregressive modeling. To
address these gaps we: 1) conduct a comprehensive study of the performance of
acoustic tokens for speech enhancement, including the effect of bitrate and
noise strength; 2) introduce a novel transducer-based autoregressive
architecture specifically designed for this task. Experiments on VoiceBank and
Libri1Mix datasets show that acoustic tokens outperform semantic tokens in
terms of preserving speaker identity, and that our autoregressive approach can
further improve performance. Nevertheless, we observe that discrete
representations still fall short compared to continuous ones, highlighting the
need for further research in this area.

effective problem-solving in novel and unfamiliar contexts. We argue that this
profound adaptability is fundamentally linked to the efficient construction and
refinement of internal representations of the environment, commonly referred to
as world models, and we refer to this adaptation mechanism as world model
induction. However, current understanding and evaluation of world models in
artificial intelligence (AI) remains narrow, often focusing on static
representations learned from training on a massive corpora of data, instead of
the efficiency and efficacy of models in learning these representations through
interaction and exploration within a novel environment. In this Perspective, we
provide a view of world model induction drawing on decades of research in
cognitive science on how humans learn and adapt so efficiently; we then call
for a new evaluation framework for assessing adaptive world models in AI.
Concretely, we propose a new benchmarking paradigm based on suites of carefully
designed games with genuine, deep and continually refreshing novelty in the
underlying game structures -- we refer to this kind of games as novel games. We
detail key desiderata for constructing these games and propose appropriate
metrics to explicitly challenge and evaluate the agent's ability for rapid
world model induction. We hope that this new evaluation framework will inspire
future evaluation efforts on world models in AI and provide a crucial step
towards developing AI systems capable of the human-like rapid adaptation and
robust generalization -- a critical component of artificial general
intelligence.

outcome. Moreover, instrumental variables also influence the treatment
assignment mechanism. This situation sets the study apart from a standard
randomized controlled trial, where the treatment assignment is random. Due to
this situation, the estimated average treatment effect becomes biased. To
address this issue, a standard approach is to incorporate the estimated
propensity score when estimating the average treatment effect. However, these
methods incur the risk of misspecification in propensity score models. To solve
this issue, a novel method called the "Self balancing neural network" (Sbnet),
which lets the model itself obtain its pseudo propensity score from the
balancing net, is proposed in this study. The proposed method estimates the
average treatment effect by using the balancing net as a key part of the
feedforward neural network. This formulation resolves the estimation of the
average treatment effect in one step. Moreover, the multi-pseudo propensity
score framework, which is estimated from the diversified balancing net and used
for the estimation of the average treatment effect, is presented. Finally, the
proposed methods are compared with state-of-the-art methods on three simulation
setups and real-world datasets. It has been shown that the proposed
self-balancing neural network shows better performance than state-of-the-art
methods.

static dataset without requiring further agent-environment interactions.
However, its practical adoption is often hindered by the need for explicit
reward annotations, which can be costly to engineer or difficult to obtain
retrospectively. To address this, we propose ReLOAD (Reinforcement Learning
with Offline Reward Annotation via Distillation), a novel reward annotation
framework for offline RL. Unlike existing methods that depend on complex
alignment procedures, our approach adapts Random Network Distillation (RND) to
generate intrinsic rewards from expert demonstrations using a simple yet
effective embedding discrepancy measure. First, we train a predictor network to
mimic a fixed target network's embeddings based on expert state transitions.
Later, the prediction error between these networks serves as a reward signal
for each transition in the static dataset. This mechanism provides a structured
reward signal without requiring handcrafted reward annotations. We provide a
formal theoretical construct that offers insights into how RND prediction
errors effectively serve as intrinsic rewards by distinguishing expert-like
transitions. Experiments on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that ReLOAD enables
robust offline policy learning and achieves performance competitive with
traditional reward-annotated methods.

modeling, but they remain computationally intensive in many-query scenarios,
such as real-time forecasting, optimal control, and uncertainty quantification.
Reduced-order modeling (ROM) addresses these challenges by constructing a
low-dimensional surrogate model but relies on a fixed discretization, which
limits flexibility across varying meshes during evaluation. Operator learning
approaches, such as neural operators, offer an alternative by parameterizing
mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, enabling adaptation to
data across different resolutions. Whereas ROM provides rigorous numerical
error estimates, neural operator learning largely focuses on discretization
convergence and invariance without quantifying the error between the
infinite-dimensional and the discretized operators. This work introduces the
reduced-order neural operator modeling (RONOM) framework, which bridges
concepts from ROM and operator learning. We establish a discretization error
bound analogous to those in ROM, and get insights into RONOM's discretization
convergence and discretization robustness. Moreover, two numerical examples are
presented that compare RONOM to existing neural operators for solving partial
differential equations. The results demonstrate that RONOM using standard
vector-to-vector neural networks achieves comparable performance in input
generalization and superior performance in both spatial super-resolution and
discretization robustness, while also offering novel insights into temporal
super-resolution scenarios.

domains like coding or mathematics. However, the extent to which they
implicitly model symbolic music remains underexplored. This paper investigates
how LLMs represent musical concepts by generating symbolic music data from
textual prompts describing combinations of genres and styles, and evaluating
their utility through recognition and generation tasks. We produce a dataset of
LLM-generated MIDI files without relying on explicit musical training. We then
train neural networks entirely on this LLM-generated MIDI dataset and perform
genre and style classification as well as melody completion, benchmarking their
performance against established models. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can
infer rudimentary musical structures and temporal relationships from text,
highlighting both their potential to implicitly encode musical patterns and
their limitations due to a lack of explicit musical context, shedding light on
their generative capabilities for symbolic music.

2) we design a GPU-accelerated ($s$,$k$)-mer encoder to optimize compression
throughput and computing resource usage; 3) we introduce data block
partitioning and Step-wise Model Passing (SMP) mechanisms for parallel
acceleration; 4) We design two compression modes PMKLC-S and PMKLC-M to meet
the complex application scenarios, where the former runs on a
resource-constrained single GPU and the latter is multi-GPU accelerated. We
benchmark PMKLC-S/M and 14 baselines (7 traditional and 7 leaning-based) on 15

baselines on the testing datasets, PMKLC-S/M achieve the average compression

improvement up to 3.036$\times$ and 10.710$\times$, respectively. Besides,
PMKLC-S/M also achieve the best robustness and competitive memory cost,
indicating its greater stability against datasets with different probability
distribution perturbations, and its strong ability to run on memory-constrained

                                        <span>  Time series prediction, a crucial task across various domains, faces
significant challenges due to the inherent complexities of time series data,
including non-stationarity, multi-scale periodicity, and transient dynamics,
particularly when tackling long-term predictions. While Transformer-based
architectures have shown promise, their quadratic complexity with sequence
length hinders their efficiency for long-term predictions. Recent advancements
in State-Space Models, such as Mamba, offer a more efficient alternative for
long-term modeling, but they cannot capture multi-scale periodicity and
transient dynamics effectively. Meanwhile, they are susceptible to data noise
issues in time series. This paper proposes a novel framework, FLDmamba (Fourier
and Laplace Transform Decomposition Mamba), addressing these limitations.
FLDmamba leverages the strengths of both Fourier and Laplace transforms to
effectively capture both multi-scale periodicity, transient dynamics within
time series data, and improve the robustness of the model to the data noise
issue. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that FLDmamba achieves superior
performance on time series prediction benchmarks, outperforming both
Transformer-based and other Mamba-based architectures. To promote the
reproducibility of our method, we have made both the code and data accessible

National Equities Exchange and Quotations (NEEQ), also known as the "New Third
Board," has become a critical financing platform for small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs). However, due to their limited scale and financial
resilience, many NEEQ-listed companies face elevated risks of financial
distress. To address this issue, we propose a multi-channel deep learning
framework that integrates structured financial indicators, textual disclosures,
and enterprise relationship data for comprehensive financial risk prediction.
Specifically, we design a Triple-Channel Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) that
processes numeric, textual, and graph-based inputs separately. These
modality-specific representations are fused using an attention-based mechanism
followed by a gating unit to enhance robustness and prediction accuracy.
Experimental results on data from 7,731 real-world NEEQ companies demonstrate
that our model significantly outperforms traditional machine learning methods
and single-modality baselines in terms of AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.
This work provides theoretical and practical insights into risk modeling for
SMEs and offers a data-driven tool to support financial regulators and
investors.

                                        <span>  Self-attention and transformer architectures have become foundational
components in modern deep learning. Recent efforts have integrated transformer
blocks into compact neural architectures for computer vision, giving rise to
various efficient vision transformers. In this work, we introduce Transformer
with Kernel Complexity Reduction, or KCR-Transformer, a compact transformer
block equipped with differentiable channel selection, guided by a novel and
sharp theoretical generalization bound. KCR-Transformer performs input/output
channel selection in the MLP layers of transformer blocks to reduce the
computational cost. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis
establishing a tight generalization bound for networks equipped with
KCR-Transformer blocks. Leveraging such strong theoretical results, the channel
pruning by KCR-Transformer is conducted in a generalization-aware manner,
ensuring that the resulting network retains a provably small generalization
error. Our KCR-Transformer is compatible with many popular and compact
transformer networks, such as ViT and Swin, and it reduces the FLOPs of the
vision transformers while maintaining or even improving the prediction
accuracy. In the experiments, we replace all the transformer blocks in the
vision transformers with KCR-Transformer blocks, leading to KCR-Transformer
networks with different backbones. The resulting TCR-Transformers achieve
superior performance on various computer vision tasks, achieving even better
performance than the original models with even less FLOPs and parameters.

transforming healthcare through the analysis and modeling of electronic health
records (EHRs). However, the inherent heterogeneity, temporal irregularity, and
domain-specific nature of EHR data present unique challenges that differ
fundamentally from those in vision and natural language tasks. This survey
offers a comprehensive overview of recent advancements at the intersection of
deep learning, large language models (LLMs), and EHR modeling. We introduce a
unified taxonomy that spans five key design dimensions: data-centric
approaches, neural architecture design, learning-focused strategies, multimodal
learning, and LLM-based modeling systems. Within each dimension, we review
representative methods addressing data quality enhancement, structural and
temporal representation, self-supervised learning, and integration with
clinical knowledge. We further highlight emerging trends such as foundation
models, LLM-driven clinical agents, and EHR-to-text translation for downstream
reasoning. Finally, we discuss open challenges in benchmarking, explainability,
clinical alignment, and generalization across diverse clinical settings. This
survey aims to provide a structured roadmap for advancing AI-driven EHR
modeling and clinical decision support. For a comprehensive list of EHR-related

                                        <span>  We consider the problem of personalizing audio to maximize user experience.
Briefly, we aim to find a filter $h^*$, which applied to any music or speech,
will maximize the user's satisfaction. This is a black-box optimization problem
since the user's satisfaction function is unknown. Substantive work has been
done on this topic where the key idea is to play audio samples to the user,
each shaped by a different filter $h_i$, and query the user for their
satisfaction scores $f(h_i)$. A family of ``surrogate" functions is then
designed to fit these scores and the optimization method gradually refines
these functions to arrive at the filter $\hat{h}^*$ that maximizes
satisfaction. In certain applications, we observe that a second type of
querying is possible where users can tell us the individual elements $h^*[j]$
of the optimal filter $h^*$. Consider an analogy from cooking where the goal is
to cook a recipe that maximizes user satisfaction. A user can be asked to score
various cooked recipes (e.g., tofu fried rice) or to score individual
ingredients (say, salt, sugar, rice, chicken, etc.). Given a budget of $B$
queries, where a query can be of either type, our goal is to find the recipe
that will maximize this user's satisfaction. Our proposal builds on Sparse
Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and shows how a hybrid approach can
outperform any one type of querying. Our results are validated through
simulations and real world experiments, where volunteers gave feedback on
music/speech audio and were able to achieve high satisfaction levels. We
believe this idea of hybrid querying opens new problems in black-box
optimization and solutions can benefit other applications beyond audio
personalization.

control in complex settings such as bimanual manipulation. However, the heavy
reliance on task-specific human demonstrations limits their generalization and
incurs high data acquisition costs. In this work, we present a new notion of
task-agnostic action paradigm that decouples action execution from
task-specific conditioning, enhancing scalability, efficiency, and
cost-effectiveness. To address the data collection challenges posed by this
paradigm -- such as low coverage density, behavioral redundancy, and safety
risks -- we introduce ATARA (Automated Task-Agnostic Random Actions), a
scalable self-supervised framework that accelerates collection by over $
30\times $ compared to human teleoperation. To further enable effective
learning from task-agnostic data, which often suffers from distribution
mismatch and irrelevant trajectories, we propose AnyPos, an inverse dynamics
model equipped with Arm-Decoupled Estimation and a Direction-Aware Decoder
(DAD). We additionally integrate a video-conditioned action validation module
to verify the feasibility of learned policies across diverse manipulation
tasks. Extensive experiments show that the AnyPos-ATARA pipeline yields a 51%
improvement in test accuracy and achieves 30-40% higher success rates in
downstream tasks such as lifting, pick-and-place, and clicking, using
replay-based video validation. Project Page:

                                        <span>  In this paper, we propose a new optimization framework, the layer separation
(LySep) model, to improve the deep learning-based methods in solving partial
differential equations. Due to the highly non-convex nature of the loss
function in deep learning, existing optimization algorithms often converge to
suboptimal local minima or suffer from gradient explosion or vanishing,
resulting in poor performance. To address these issues, we introduce auxiliary
variables to separate the layers of deep neural networks. Specifically, the
output and its derivatives of each layer are represented by auxiliary
variables, effectively decomposing the deep architecture into a series of
shallow architectures. New loss functions with auxiliary variables are
established, in which only variables from two neighboring layers are coupled.
Corresponding algorithms based on alternating directions are developed, where
many variables can be updated optimally in closed forms. Moreover, we provide
theoretical analyses demonstrating the consistency between the LySep model and
the original deep model. High-dimensional numerical results validate our theory
and demonstrate the advantages of LySep in minimizing loss and reducing
solution error.

                                        <span>  Reliable anticipation of traffic accidents is essential for advancing
autonomous driving systems. However, this objective is limited by two
fundamental challenges: the scarcity of diverse, high-quality training data and
the frequent absence of crucial object-level cues due to environmental
disruptions or sensor deficiencies. To tackle these issues, we propose a
comprehensive framework combining generative scene augmentation with adaptive
temporal reasoning. Specifically, we develop a video generation pipeline that
utilizes a world model guided by domain-informed prompts to create
high-resolution, statistically consistent driving scenarios, particularly
enriching the coverage of edge cases and complex interactions. In parallel, we
construct a dynamic prediction model that encodes spatio-temporal relationships
through strengthened graph convolutions and dilated temporal operators,
effectively addressing data incompleteness and transient visual noise.
Furthermore, we release a new benchmark dataset designed to better capture
diverse real-world driving risks. Extensive experiments on public and newly
released datasets confirm that our framework enhances both the accuracy and
lead time of accident anticipation, offering a robust solution to current data
and modeling limitations in safety-critical autonomous driving applications.

anticipation system is crucial for contemporary autonomous driving

we propose an accident anticipation framework employing a dual-branch

with structured textual data derived from accident reports. Furthermore, we
introduce a feature aggregation method that facilitates seamless integration of
multimodal inputs through large models (GPT-4o, Long-CLIP), complemented by
targeted prompt engineering strategies to produce actionable feedback and
standardized accident archives. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on
benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, and A3D) validate the superior predictive
accuracy, enhanced responsiveness, reduced computational overhead, and improved
interpretability of our approach, thus establishing a new benchmark for
state-of-the-art performance in traffic accident anticipation.

quality varies and redundancy is common. Data-centric approaches such as
dataset pruning have shown promise in improving training efficiency and model
performance. However, most existing methods rely on static heuristics or
task-specific metrics, limiting their robustness and generalizability across
domains. In this work, we introduce a dynamic dataset pruning framework that
adaptively selects training samples based on both task-driven difficulty and
cross-modality semantic consistency. By incorporating supervision from
pretrained multimodal foundation models, our approach captures training
dynamics while effectively filtering out uninformative samples. Our work
highlights the potential of integrating cross-modality alignment for robust
sample selection, advancing data-centric learning toward more efficient and
robust practices across application domains.

dynamics remain theoretically unclear-we develop a continuous-time,
matrix-valued stochastic differential equation (SDE) framework that rigorously
connects the microscopic dynamics of SGD to the macroscopic evolution of
singular-value spectra in weight matrices. We derive exact SDEs showing that
squared singular values follow Dyson Brownian motion with eigenvalue repulsion,
and characterize stationary distributions as gamma-type densities with
power-law tails, providing the first theoretical explanation for the
empirically observed 'bulk+tail' spectral structure in trained networks.
Through controlled experiments on transformer and MLP architectures, we
validate our theoretical predictions and demonstrate quantitative agreement
between SDE-based forecasts and observed spectral evolution, providing a
rigorous foundation for understanding why deep learning works.

of distributed machine learning, enabling multiple clients such as mobile
devices, edge nodes, or organizations to collaboratively train a shared global
model without the need to centralize sensitive data. This decentralized
approach addresses growing concerns around data privacy, security, and
regulatory compliance, making it particularly attractive in domains such as
healthcare, finance, and smart IoT systems. This survey provides a concise yet
comprehensive overview of Federated Learning, beginning with its core
architecture and communication protocol. We discuss the standard FL lifecycle,
including local training, model aggregation, and global updates. A particular
emphasis is placed on key technical challenges such as handling non-IID
(non-independent and identically distributed) data, mitigating system and
hardware heterogeneity, reducing communication overhead, and ensuring privacy
through mechanisms like differential privacy and secure aggregation.
Furthermore, we examine emerging trends in FL research, including personalized
FL, cross-device versus cross-silo settings, and integration with other
paradigms such as reinforcement learning and quantum computing. We also
highlight real-world applications and summarize benchmark datasets and
evaluation metrics commonly used in FL research. Finally, we outline open
research problems and future directions to guide the development of scalable,

advancements in robotic manipulation. However, the requirement for robot
hardware in the process fundamentally constrains the scale of the data. In this
paper, we explore training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using egocentric
human videos. The benefit of using human videos is not only for their scale but
more importantly for the richness of scenes and tasks. With a VLA trained on
human video that predicts human wrist and hand actions, we can perform Inverse
Kinematics and retargeting to convert the human actions to robot actions. We
fine-tune the model using a few robot manipulation demonstrations to obtain the
robot policy, namely EgoVLA. We propose a simulation benchmark called Ego
Humanoid Manipulation Benchmark, where we design diverse bimanual manipulation
tasks with demonstrations. We fine-tune and evaluate EgoVLA with Ego Humanoid
Manipulation Benchmark and show significant improvements over baselines and
ablate the importance of human data. Videos can be found on our website:

                                        <span>  A long-standing goal in AI is to build agents that can solve a variety of
tasks across different environments, including previously unseen ones. Two
dominant approaches tackle this challenge: (i) reinforcement learning (RL),
which learns policies through trial and error, and (ii) optimal control, which
plans actions using a learned or known dynamics model. However, their relative
strengths and weaknesses remain underexplored in the setting where agents must
learn from offline trajectories without reward annotations. In this work, we
systematically analyze the performance of different RL and control-based
methods under datasets of varying quality. On the RL side, we consider
goal-conditioned and zero-shot approaches. On the control side, we train a
latent dynamics model using the Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA)
and use it for planning. We study how dataset properties-such as data
diversity, trajectory quality, and environment variability-affect the
performance of these approaches. Our results show that model-free RL excels
when abundant, high-quality data is available, while model-based planning
excels in generalization to novel environment layouts, trajectory stitching,
and data-efficiency. Notably, planning with a latent dynamics model emerges as
a promising approach for zero-shot generalization from suboptimal data.

in large language model (LLM) development through their efficient parameter
utilization. These models achieve substantial performance improvements at
reduced inference costs. However, the deployment of SMoE models faces
constraints from extensive memory requirements of expert components in
resource-limited environments. To address these limitations, this paper
introduces Hierarchical Clustering for Sparsely activated Mixture of Experts
(HC-SMoE), a task-agnostic expert merging framework for parameter reduction
without retraining. HC-SMoE introduces a novel hierarchical clustering approach
based on expert outputs to ensure merging robustness independent of routing
decisions. The proposed output-based clustering method enables effective
capture of functional relationships between experts for large-scale
architectures. We provide theoretical analysis and comprehensive evaluations
across multiple zero-shot language tasks to demonstrate HC-SMoE's effectiveness
in state-of-the-art models including Qwen and Mixtral. The experimental results
validate HC-SMoE's superior performance and practical applicability for
real-world deployments.

shown progress in climate simulations, yet leveraging them for useful climate
predictions needs exploration. Here we show this feasibility using Neural
General Circulation Model (NeuralGCM), a hybrid ML-physics atmospheric model
developed by Google, for seasonal predictions of large-scale atmospheric
variability and Northern Hemisphere tropical cyclone (TC) activity. Inspired by
physical model studies, we simplify boundary conditions, assuming sea surface
temperature (SST) and sea ice follow their climatological cycle but persist
anomalies present at the initialization time. With such forcings, NeuralGCM can
generate 100 simulation days in ~8 minutes with a single Graphics Processing
Unit (GPU), while simulating realistic atmospheric circulation and TC
climatology patterns. This configuration yields useful seasonal predictions
(July to November) for the tropical atmosphere and various TC activity metrics.
Notably, the predicted and observed TC frequency in the North Atlantic and East
Pacific basins are significantly correlated during 1990 to 2023 (r=~0.7),
suggesting prediction skill comparable to existing physical GCMs. Despite
challenges associated with model resolution and simplified boundary forcings,
the model-predicted interannual variations demonstrate significant correlations
with the observation, including the sub-basin TC tracks (p<0.1) and basin-wide
accumulated cyclone energy (p<0.01) of the North Atlantic and North Pacific
basins. These findings highlight the promise of leveraging ML models with
physical insights to model TC risks and deliver seamless weather-climate
predictions.

                                        <span>  Modern neural networks (NNs) often do not generalize well in the presence of
a "covariate shift"; that is, in situations where the training and test data
distributions differ, but the conditional distribution of classification labels
remains unchanged. In such cases, NN generalization can be reduced to a problem
of learning more domain-invariant features. Domain adaptation (DA) methods
include a range of techniques aimed at achieving this; however, these methods
have struggled with the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning, which then
incurs significant computational costs. In this work, we introduce SIDDA, an
out-of-the-box DA training algorithm built upon the Sinkhorn divergence, that
can achieve effective domain alignment with minimal hyperparameter tuning and
computational overhead. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on multiple
simulated and real datasets of varying complexity, including simple shapes,
handwritten digits, and real astronomical observations. SIDDA is compatible
with a variety of NN architectures, and it works particularly well in improving
classification accuracy and model calibration when paired with equivariant
neural networks (ENNs). We find that SIDDA enhances the generalization
capabilities of NNs, achieving up to a $\approx40\%$ improvement in
classification accuracy on unlabeled target data. We also study the efficacy of
DA on ENNs with respect to the varying group orders of the dihedral group
$D_N$, and find that the model performance improves as the degree of
equivariance increases. Finally, we find that SIDDA enhances model calibration
on both source and target data--achieving over an order of magnitude
improvement in the ECE and Brier score. SIDDA's versatility, combined with its
automated approach to domain alignment, has the potential to advance
multi-dataset studies by enabling the development of highly generalizable
models.

                                        <span>  Crowdworking is a cost-efficient solution for acquiring class labels. Since
these labels are subject to noise, various approaches to learning from crowds
have been proposed. Typically, these approaches are evaluated with default
hyperparameter configurations, resulting in unfair and suboptimal performance,
or with hyperparameter configurations tuned via a validation set with ground
truth class labels, representing an often unrealistic scenario. Moreover, both
setups can produce different approach rankings, complicating study comparisons.
Therefore, we introduce crowd-hpo as a framework for evaluating approaches to
learning from crowds in combination with criteria to select well-performing
hyperparameter configurations with access only to noisy crowd-labeled
validation data. Extensive experiments with neural networks demonstrate that
these criteria select hyperparameter configurations, which improve the learning
from crowd approaches' generalization performances, measured on separate test
sets with ground truth labels. Hence, incorporating such criteria into
experimental studies is essential for enabling fairer and more realistic
benchmarking.

resource allocation policies with generative diffusion models (GDMs). We
formulate the allocation problem as the maximization of an ergodic utility
function subject to ergodic Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. Given samples
from a stochastic expert policy that yields a near-optimal solution to the
constrained optimization problem, we train a GDM policy to imitate the expert
and generate new samples from the optimal distribution. We achieve near-optimal
performance through the sequential execution of the generated samples. To
enable generalization to a family of network configurations, we parameterize
the backward diffusion process with a graph neural network (GNN) architecture.
We present numerical results in a case study of power control.

                                        <span>  Clustering is one of the most important tools for analysis of large datasets,
and perhaps the most popular clustering algorithm is Lloyd's algorithm for
$k$-means. This algorithm takes $n$ vectors
$V=[v_1,\dots,v_n]\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times n}$ and outputs $k$ centroids
$c_1,\dots,c_k\in\mathbb{R}^d$; these partition the vectors into clusters based
on which centroid is closest to a particular vector. We present a classical
$\varepsilon$-$k$-means algorithm that performs an approximate version of one
iteration of Lloyd's algorithm with time complexity
$\tilde{O}\big(\frac{\|V\|_F^2}{n}\frac{k^{2}d}{\varepsilon^2}(k +
\log{n})\big)$, exponentially improving the dependence on the data size $n$ and
matching that of the "$q$-means" quantum algorithm originally proposed by
Kerenidis, Landman, Luongo, and Prakash (NeurIPS'19). Moreover, we propose an
improved $q$-means quantum algorithm with time complexity
$\tilde{O}\big(\frac{\|V\|_F}{\sqrt{n}}\frac{k^{3/2}d}{\varepsilon}(\sqrt{k}+\sqrt{d})(\sqrt{k}
+ \log{n})\big)$ that quadratically improves the runtime of our classical
$\varepsilon$-$k$-means algorithm in several parameters. Our quantum algorithm
does not rely on quantum linear algebra primitives of prior work, but instead
only uses QRAM to prepare simple states based on the current iteration's
clusters and multivariate quantum amplitude estimation. Finally, we provide
classical and quantum query lower bounds, showing that our algorithms are
optimal in most parameters.

                                        <span>  Climate change is one of the defining challenges of the 21st century, and
many in the robotics community are looking for ways to contribute. This paper
presents a roadmap for climate-relevant robotics research, identifying
high-impact opportunities for collaboration between roboticists and experts
across climate domains such as energy, the built environment, transportation,
industry, land use, and Earth sciences. These applications include problems
such as energy systems optimization, construction, precision agriculture,
building envelope retrofits, autonomous trucking, and large-scale environmental
monitoring. Critically, we include opportunities to apply not only physical
robots but also the broader robotics toolkit - including planning, perception,
control, and estimation algorithms - to climate-relevant problems. A central
goal of this roadmap is to inspire new research directions and collaboration by
highlighting specific, actionable problems at the intersection of robotics and
climate. This work represents a collaboration between robotics researchers and
domain experts in various climate disciplines, and it serves as an invitation
to the robotics community to bring their expertise to bear on urgent climate
priorities.

of how efficiently shallow neural networks with the ReLU$^k$ activation
function can approximate functions from Sobolev spaces $W^s(L_p(\Omega))$ with
error measured in the $L_q(\Omega)$-norm. Utilizing the Radon transform and
recent results from discrepancy theory, we provide a simple proof of nearly
optimal approximation rates in a variety of cases, including when $q\leq p$,
$p\geq 2$, and $s \leq k + (d+1)/2$. The rates we derive are optimal up to
logarithmic factors, and significantly generalize existing results. An
interesting consequence is that the adaptivity of shallow ReLU$^k$ neural
networks enables them to obtain optimal approximation rates for smoothness up
to order $s = k + (d+1)/2$, even though they represent piecewise polynomials of
fixed degree $k$.

                                        <span>  Popular PEFT methods reduce trainable parameter count for fine-tuning by
parameterizing new low-rank or sparse trainable weights in parallel to the
frozen pre-trained weights $W$. However, these weights are trained from
scratch, and there exists a performance gap between these methods and full
fine-tuning, especially in low-budget settings. We introduce VectorFit, a new
way of parameterization that efficiently utilizes the existing knowledge
embedded in $W$ by adaptively training their singular vectors and biases. We
show that utilizing the structural and transformational properties of $W$ in
this way can lead to high-rank incremental weight matrices $\Delta W$,
comparable to that of full fine-tuning. VectorFit delivers superior results
with \textbf{9$\boldsymbol\times$} fewer trainable parameters than the leading
PEFT methods. Through comprehensive experiments across 19 datasets covering a
wide range of language and vision tasks such as natural language understanding
and generation, question answering, image classification, and image generation,
we demonstrate that VectorFit surpasses baselines in terms of performance as a
function of parameter-efficiency.

                                        <span>  Reinforcement Learning's high sensitivity to hyperparameters is a source of
instability and inefficiency, creating significant challenges for
practitioners. Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) algorithms have been developed
to address this issue, among them Population-Based Training (PBT) stands out
for its ability to generate hyperparameters schedules instead of fixed
configurations. PBT trains a population of agents, each with its own
hyperparameters, frequently ranking them and replacing the worst performers
with mutations of the best agents. These intermediate selection steps can cause
PBT to focus on short-term improvements, leading it to get stuck in local
optima and eventually fall behind vanilla Random Search over longer timescales.
This paper studies how this greediness issue is connected to the choice of
evolution frequency, the rate at which the selection is done. We propose
Multiple-Frequencies Population-Based Training (MF-PBT), a novel HPO algorithm
that addresses greediness by employing sub-populations, each evolving at
distinct frequencies. MF-PBT introduces a migration process to transfer
information between sub-populations, with an asymmetric design to balance short
and long-term optimization. Extensive experiments on the Brax suite demonstrate
that MF-PBT improves sample efficiency and long-term performance, even without
actually tuning hyperparameters.

rule-based approaches. Imitation Learning (IL) remains the dominant paradigm,
benefiting from large-scale human demonstration datasets, but it suffers from
inherent limitations such as distribution shift and imitation gaps.
Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a promising alternative, yet its adoption
in AD remains limited due to the lack of standardized and efficient research
frameworks. To this end, we introduce V-Max, an open research framework
providing all the necessary tools to make RL practical for AD. V-Max is built
on Waymax, a hardware-accelerated AD simulator designed for large-scale
experimentation. We extend it using ScenarioNet's approach, enabling the fast

                                        <span>  We argue that diffusion models' success in modeling complex distributions is,
for the most part, coming from their input conditioning. This paper
investigates the representation used to condition diffusion models from the
perspective that ideal representations should improve sample fidelity, be easy
to generate, and be compositional to allow out-of-training samples generation.
We introduce Discrete Latent Code (DLC), an image representation derived from
Simplicial Embeddings trained with a self-supervised learning objective. DLCs
are sequences of discrete tokens, as opposed to the standard continuous image
embeddings. They are easy to generate and their compositionality enables
sampling of novel images beyond the training distribution. Diffusion models
trained with DLCs have improved generation fidelity, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for unconditional image generation on ImageNet. Additionally,
we show that composing DLCs allows the image generator to produce
out-of-distribution samples that coherently combine the semantics of images in
diverse ways. Finally, we showcase how DLCs can enable text-to-image generation
by leveraging large-scale pretrained language models. We efficiently finetune a
text diffusion language model to generate DLCs that produce novel samples
outside of the image generator training distribution.

                                        <span>  The detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration
has ushered in a new era of observational astronomy, emphasizing the need for
rapid and detailed parameter estimation and population-level analyses.
Traditional Bayesian inference methods, particularly Markov chain Monte Carlo,
face significant computational challenges when dealing with the
high-dimensional parameter spaces and complex noise characteristics inherent in
gravitational wave data. This review examines the emerging role of
simulation-based inference methods in gravitational wave astronomy, with a
focus on approaches that leverage machine-learning techniques such as
normalizing flows and neural posterior estimation. We provide a comprehensive
overview of the theoretical foundations underlying various simulation-based
inference methods, including neural posterior estimation, neural ratio
estimation, neural likelihood estimation, flow matching, and consistency
models. We explore the applications of these methods across diverse
gravitational wave data processing scenarios, from single-source parameter
estimation and overlapping signal analysis to testing general relativity and
conducting population studies. Although these techniques demonstrate speed
improvements over traditional methods in controlled studies, their
model-dependent nature and sensitivity to prior assumptions are barriers to
their widespread adoption. Their accuracy, which is similar to that of
conventional methods, requires further validation across broader parameter
spaces and noise conditions.

                                        <span>  This paper tackles the problem of the worst-class error rate, instead of the
standard error rate averaged over all classes. For example, a three-class
classification task with class-wise error rates of 10%, 10%, and 40% has a
worst-class error rate of 40%, whereas the average is 20% under the
class-balanced condition. The worst-class error is important in many
applications. For example, in a medical image classification task, it would not
be acceptable for the malignant tumor class to have a 40% error rate, while the
benign and healthy classes have a 10% error rates. To avoid overfitting in
worst-class error minimization using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), we design a
problem formulation for bounding the worst-class error instead of achieving
zero worst-class error. Moreover, to correctly bound the worst-class error, we
propose a boosting approach which ensembles DNNs. We give training and
generalization worst-class-error bound. Experimental results show that the
algorithm lowers worst-class test error rates while avoiding overfitting to the
training set. This code is available at

framework that integrates physical constraints into neural time series models
to improve their ability to capture complex dynamics. We apply PINT to the ERA5
WeatherBench dataset, focusing on long-term forecasting of 2m-temperature data.
PINT incorporates the Simple Harmonic Oscillator Equation as a physics-informed
prior, embedding its periodic dynamics into RNN, LSTM, and GRU architectures.
This equation's analytical solutions (sine and cosine functions) facilitate
rigorous evaluation of the benefits of incorporating physics-informed
constraints. By benchmarking against a linear regression baseline derived from
its exact solutions, we quantify the impact of embedding physical principles in
data-driven models. Unlike traditional time series models that rely on future
observations, PINT is designed for practical forecasting. Using only the first
90 days of observed data, it iteratively predicts the next two years,
addressing challenges posed by limited real-time updates. Experiments on the
WeatherBench dataset demonstrate PINT's ability to generalize, capture periodic
trends, and align with physical principles. This study highlights the potential
of physics-informed neural models in bridging machine learning and
interpretable climate applications.

                                        <span>  Post-training quantization (PTQ) reduces a model's memory footprint by
mapping full precision weights into low bit weights without costly retraining,
but can degrade its downstream performance especially in low 2- to 3-bit
settings. We develop a new mixed-precision PTQ approach, Task-Circuit
Quantization (TaCQ), that draws parallels to automated circuit discovery,
directly conditioning the quantization process on specific weight circuits --
which we define as sets of weights associated with downstream task performance.
These weights are kept as 16-bit weights, while others are quantized,
maintaining performance while only adding a marginal memory cost. Specifically,
TaCQ contrasts unquantized model weights with a uniformly-quantized model to
estimate the expected change in weights due to quantization and uses gradient
information to predict the resulting impact on task performance, allowing us to
preserve task-specific weights. We compare TaCQ-based quantization to existing
mixed-precision quantization methods when conditioning both on general-purpose
and task-specific data. Across QA, math reasoning, and text-to-SQL tasks for
both Llama-3 and Qwen2.5, we find that TaCQ outperforms baselines using the
same calibration data and a lower weight budget, achieving major improvements
in the 2 and 3-bit regime. With only 3.1 bits we are able to recover 96% of
Llama-3-8B-Instruct's unquantized 16-bit MMLU performance, obtaining a 5.25%
absolute improvement over SPQR. We also observe consistently large gains over
existing methods in the 2-bit regime, with an average gain of 14.74% over the
strongest baseline, SliM-LLM. Moreover, we observe a 7.20% gain without
conditioning on specific tasks, showing TaCQ's ability to identify important
weights is not limited to task-conditioned settings.

                                        <span>  Despite the outstanding performance in vision-language reasoning, Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) might generate hallucinated contents that do not
exist in the given image. Most existing LVLM hallucination benchmarks are
constrained to evaluate the object-related hallucinations. However, the
potential hallucination on the relations between two objects, i.e., relation
hallucination, still lacks investigation. To remedy that, we design a unified
framework to measure the object and relation hallucination in LVLMs
simultaneously. The core idea of our framework is to evaluate hallucinations
via (object, relation, object) triplets extracted from LVLMs' responses, making
it easily generalizable to different vision-language tasks. Based on our
framework, we further introduce Tri-HE, a novel Triplet-level Hallucination
Evaluation benchmark which can be used to study both object and relation
hallucination at the same time. With comprehensive evaluations on Tri-HE, we
observe that the relation hallucination issue is even more serious than object
hallucination among existing LVLMs, highlighting a previously neglected problem
towards reliable LVLMs. Moreover, based on our findings, we design a simple
training-free approach that effectively mitigates hallucinations for LVLMs. Our
dataset and code for the reproduction of our experiments are available publicly
at https://github.com/wujunjie1998/Tri-HE.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we unify more than 10 existing one-step diffusion distillation
approaches, such as Diff-Instruct, DMD, SIM, SiD, $f$-distill, etc, inside a
theory-driven framework which we name the \textbf{\emph{Uni-Instruct}}.
Uni-Instruct is motivated by our proposed diffusion expansion theory of the
$f$-divergence family. Then we introduce key theories that overcome the
intractability issue of the original expanded $f$-divergence, resulting in an
equivalent yet tractable loss that effectively trains one-step diffusion models
by minimizing the expanded $f$-divergence family. The novel unification
introduced by Uni-Instruct not only offers new theoretical contributions that
help understand existing approaches from a high-level perspective but also
leads to state-of-the-art one-step diffusion generation performances. On the
CIFAR10 generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves record-breaking Frechet
Inception Distance (FID) values of \textbf{\emph{1.46}} for unconditional
generation and \textbf{\emph{1.38}} for conditional generation. On the
ImageNet-$64\times 64$ generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves a new SoTA
one-step generation FID of \textbf{\emph{1.02}}, which outperforms its 79-step
teacher diffusion with a significant improvement margin of 1.33 (1.02 vs 2.35).
We also apply Uni-Instruct on broader tasks like text-to-3D generation. For
text-to-3D generation, Uni-Instruct gives decent results, which slightly
outperforms previous methods, such as SDS and VSD, in terms of both generation
quality and diversity. Both the solid theoretical and empirical contributions
of Uni-Instruct will potentially help future studies on one-step diffusion
distillation and knowledge transferring of diffusion models.

                                        <span>  The quality of probabilistic forecasts is crucial for decision-making under
uncertainty. While proper scoring rules incentivize truthful reporting of
precise forecasts, they fall short when forecasters face epistemic uncertainty
about their beliefs, limiting their use in safety-critical domains where
decision-makers (DMs) prioritize proper uncertainty management. To address
this, we propose a framework for scoring imprecise forecasts -- forecasts given
as a set of beliefs. Despite existing impossibility results for deterministic
scoring rules, we enable truthful elicitation by drawing connection to social
choice theory and introducing a two-way communication framework where DMs first
share their aggregation rules (e.g., averaging or min-max) used in downstream
decisions for resolving forecast ambiguity. This, in turn, helps forecasters
resolve indecision during elicitation. We further show that truthful
elicitation of imprecise forecasts is achievable using proper scoring rules
randomized over the aggregation procedure. Our approach allows DM to elicit and
integrate the forecaster's epistemic uncertainty into their decision-making
process, thus improving credibility.

to provide generating capacity and energy, there is an expanding global need
for historically accurate, spatiotemporally continuous, high-resolution wind
data. Conventional downscaling methods for generating these data based on
numerical weather prediction have a high computational burden and require
extensive tuning for historical accuracy. In this work, we present a novel deep
learning-based spatiotemporal downscaling method using generative adversarial
networks (GANs) for generating historically accurate high-resolution wind
resource data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting
Reanalysis version 5 data (ERA5). In contrast to previous approaches, which
used coarsened high-resolution data as low-resolution training data, we use
true low-resolution simulation outputs. We show that by training a GAN model
with ERA5 as the low-resolution input and Wind Integration National Dataset
Toolkit (WTK) data as the high-resolution target, we achieved results
comparable in historical accuracy and spatiotemporal variability to
conventional dynamical downscaling. This GAN-based downscaling method
additionally reduces computational costs over dynamical downscaling by two
orders of magnitude. We applied this approach to downscale 30 km, hourly ERA5
data to 2 km, 5 min wind data for January 2000 through December 2023 at
multiple hub heights over Ukraine, Moldova, and part of Romania. This 24-year
data record is the first member of the super-resolution for renewable energy
resource data with wind from the reanalysis data dataset (Sup3rWind).

allows for studying sequences from their generating functions, with many
operations that can be equivalently defined on the original sequence and its
$z$-transform. In particular, the z-transform method focuses on asymptotic
behaviors and allows the use of Taylor expansions. We present a sequence of
results of increasing significance and difficulty for linear models and
optimization algorithms, demonstrating the effectiveness and versatility of the
z-transform method in deriving new asymptotic results. Starting from the
simplest gradient descent iterations in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space,
we show how the spectral dimension characterizes the convergence behavior. We
then extend the analysis to Nesterov acceleration, averaging techniques, and
stochastic gradient descent.

the medical domain, suffers from the lack of high-quality data set, mainly due
to privacy-related issues. In addition, the recent increase in Vision Language
Models (VLM) leads to the need for multimodal medical data sets, where clinical
reports and findings are attached to the corresponding medical scans. This
paper illustrates the entire workflow for building the MedPix 2.0 data set.
Starting with the well-known multimodal data set
MedPix\textsuperscript{\textregistered}, mainly used by physicians, nurses, and
healthcare students for Continuing Medical Education purposes, a semi-automatic
pipeline was developed to extract visual and textual data followed by a manual
curing procedure in which noisy samples were removed, thus creating a MongoDB
database. Along with the data set, we developed a Graphical User Interface
aimed at navigating efficiently the MongoDB instance and obtaining the raw data
that can be easily used for training and/or fine-tuning VLMs. To enforce this
point, in this work, we first recall DR-Minerva, a Retrieve Augmented
Generation-based VLM model trained upon MedPix 2.0. DR-Minerva predicts the
body part and the modality used to scan its input image. We also propose the
extension of DR-Minerva with a Knowledge Graph that uses Llama 3.1 Instruct 8B,
and leverages MedPix 2.0. The resulting architecture can be queried in a
end-to-end manner, as a medical decision support system. MedPix 2.0 is
available on GitHub.

                                        <span>  White Matter Hyperintensities (WMH) are key neuroradiological markers of
small vessel disease present in brain MRI. Assessment of WMH is important in
research and clinics. However, WMH are challenging to segment due to their high
variability in shape, location, size, poorly defined borders, and similar
intensity profile to other pathologies (e.g stroke lesions) and artefacts (e.g
head motion). In this work, we assess the utility and semantic properties of
the most effective techniques for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in
segmentation for the WMH segmentation task across multiple test-time data
distributions. We find UQ techniques reduce 'silent failure' by identifying in
UQ maps small WMH clusters in the deep white matter that are unsegmented by the
model. A combination of Stochastic Segmentation Networks with Deep Ensembles
also yields the highest Dice and lowest Absolute Volume Difference % (AVD)
score and can highlight areas where there is ambiguity between WMH and stroke
lesions. We further demonstrate the downstream utility of UQ, proposing a novel
method for classification of the clinical Fazekas score using spatial features
extracted from voxelwise WMH probability and UQ maps. We show that
incorporating WMH uncertainty information improves Fazekas classification
performance and calibration. Our model with (UQ and spatial WMH
features)/(spatial WMH features)/(WMH volume only) achieves a balanced accuracy
score of 0.74/0.67/0.62, and root brier score of 0.65/0.72/0.74 in the Deep WMH
and balanced accuracy of 0.74/0.73/0.71 and root brier score of 0.64/0.66/0.68
in the Periventricular region. We further demonstrate that stochastic UQ
techniques with high sample diversity can improve the detection of poor quality
segmentations.

                                        <span>  We analyze the implicit bias of constant step stochastic subgradient descent
(SGD). We consider the setting of binary classification with homogeneous neural
networks - a large class of deep neural networks with ReLU-type activation
functions such as MLPs and CNNs without biases. We interpret the dynamics of
normalized SGD iterates as an Euler-like discretization of a conservative field
flow that is naturally associated to the normalized classification margin.
Owing to this interpretation, we show that normalized SGD iterates converge to
the set of critical points of the normalized margin at late-stage training
(i.e., assuming that the data is correctly classified with positive normalized
margin). Up to our knowledge, this is the first extension of the analysis of
Lyu and Li (2020) on the discrete dynamics of gradient descent to the nonsmooth
and stochastic setting. Our main result applies to binary classification with
exponential or logistic losses. We additionally discuss extensions to more
general settings.

                                        <span>  Foundation multi-modal models are often designed by stitching of multiple
existing pretrained uni-modal models: for example, an image classifier with an
text model. This stitching process is performed by training a connector module
that aims to align the representation spaces of these uni-modal models towards
a multi-modal objective. However, given the complexity of training such
connectors on large scale web-based datasets coupled with the ever-increasing
number of available pretrained uni-modal models, the task of uni-modal models
selection and subsequent connector module training becomes computationally
demanding. To address this under-studied critical problem, we propose
Hypernetwork Model Alignment (Hyma), a novel all-in-one solution for optimal
uni-modal model selection and connector training by leveraging hypernetworks.
Specifically, our framework utilizes the parameter prediction capability of a
hypernetwork to obtain jointly trained connector modules for $N \times M$
combinations of uni-modal models. In our experiments, Hyma reduces the cost of
searching for the best performing uni-modal model pair by $10\times$, while
matching the ranking and trained connector performance obtained via grid search
across a suite of diverse multi-modal benchmarks.

                                        <span>  For overparameterized optimization tasks, such as those found in modern
machine learning, global minima are generally not unique. In order to
understand generalization in these settings, it is vital to study to which
minimum an optimization algorithm converges. The possibility of having minima
that are unstable under the dynamics imposed by the optimization algorithm
limits the potential minima that the algorithm can find. In this paper, we
characterize the global minima that are dynamically stable/unstable for both
deterministic and stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In particular, we
introduce a characteristic Lyapunov exponent that depends on the local dynamics
around a global minimum and rigorously prove that the sign of this Lyapunov
exponent determines whether SGD can accumulate at the respective global
minimum.

                                        <span>  Recently, deep learning methods have gained remarkable achievements in the
field of image restoration for remote sensing (RS). However, most existing RS
image restoration methods focus mainly on conventional first-order degradation
models, which may not effectively capture the imaging mechanisms of remote
sensing images. Furthermore, many RS image restoration approaches that use deep
learning are often criticized for their lacks of architecture transparency and
model interpretability. To address these problems, we propose a novel
progressive restoration network for high-order degradation imaging (HDI-PRNet),
to progressively restore different image degradation. HDI-PRNet is developed
based on the theoretical framework of degradation imaging, also Markov
properties of the high-order degradation process and Maximum a posteriori (MAP)
estimation, offering the benefit of mathematical interpretability within the
unfolding network. The framework is composed of three main components: a module
for image denoising that relies on proximal mapping prior learning, a module
for image deblurring that integrates Neumann series expansion with dual-domain
degradation learning, and a module for super-resolution. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on both synthetic and
real remote sensing images.

essential for neuro-oncology diagnosis and treatment planning. Despite advances
in deep learning methods, automatic segmentation remains challenging due to
tumor morphological heterogeneity and complex three-dimensional spatial
relationships. Current techniques primarily rely on visual features extracted
from MRI sequences while underutilizing semantic knowledge embedded in medical
reports. This research presents a multi-level fusion architecture that
integrates pixel-level, feature-level, and semantic-level information,
facilitating comprehensive processing from low-level data to high-level
concepts. The semantic-level fusion pathway combines the semantic understanding
capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models with the
spatial feature extraction advantages of 3D U-Net through three mechanisms:
3D-2D semantic bridging, cross-modal semantic guidance, and semantic-based
attention mechanisms. Experimental validation on the BraTS 2020 dataset
demonstrates that the proposed model achieves an overall Dice coefficient of
0.8567, representing a 4.8% improvement compared to traditional 3D U-Net, with
a 7.3% Dice coefficient increase in the clinically important enhancing tumor

signal recovery performance. The broad relevance of the SMM and its
corresponding EM recovery algorithm is demonstrated by applying the technique
to different data types. The first case study is a biomedical research
application, utilizing an imaging mass spectrometry dataset to explore the
molecular content of a rat brain tissue section at micrometer scale. The second
case study demonstrates SMM performance in a computer vision application,
segmenting a hyperspectral imaging dataset into underlying patterns. While the
measurement modalities differ substantially, in both case studies SMM is shown
to recover signals that were missed by traditional methods such as k-means
clustering and GMM.

                                        <span>  Humans perceive the world through multimodal cues to understand and interact
with the environment. Learning a scene representation for multiple modalities
enhances comprehension of the physical world. However, modality conflicts,
arising from inherent distinctions among different modalities, present two
critical challenges: property disparity and granularity disparity. To address
these challenges, we propose a general framework, MMOne, to represent multiple
modalities in one scene, which can be readily extended to additional
modalities. Specifically, a modality modeling module with a novel modality
indicator is proposed to capture the unique properties of each modality.
Additionally, we design a multimodal decomposition mechanism to separate
multi-modal Gaussians into single-modal Gaussians based on modality
differences. We address the essential distinctions among modalities by
disentangling multimodal information into shared and modality-specific
components, resulting in a more compact and efficient multimodal scene
representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently
enhances the representation capability for each modality and is scalable to
additional modalities. The code is available at

approaches often combine responses from multi-cultural populations, obscuring
demographic differences and risking amplifying biases. We conducted a
large-scale urban visual perception survey of streetscapes worldwide using
street view imagery, examining how demographics -- including gender, age,
income, education, race and ethnicity, and, for the first time, personality
traits -- shape perceptions among 1,000 participants with balanced demographics
from five countries and 45 nationalities. This dataset, Street Perception
Evaluation Considering Socioeconomics (SPECS), reveals demographic- and
personality-based differences across six traditional indicators (safe, lively,
wealthy, beautiful, boring, depressing) and four new ones (live nearby, walk,
cycle, green). Location-based sentiments further shape these preferences.
Machine learning models trained on existing global datasets tend to
overestimate positive indicators and underestimate negative ones compared to
human responses, underscoring the need for local context. Our study aspires to
rectify the myopic treatment of street perception, which rarely considers
demographics or personality traits.

clustering, refers to the problem of partitioning $n$ data points into $k$
clusters, with the objective of minimizing the total sum of squared Euclidean
distances between each point and the center of its assigned cluster. We propose
an efficient algorithm for solving large-scale MSSC instances, which combines
column generation (CG) with dynamic constraint aggregation (DCA) to effectively
reduce the number of constraints considered in the CG master problem. DCA was
originally conceived to reduce degeneracy in set partitioning problems by
utilizing an aggregated restricted master problem obtained from a partition of
the set partitioning constraints into disjoint clusters. In this work, we
explore the use of DCA within a CG algorithm for MSSC exact solution. Our
method is fine-tuned by a series of ablation studies on DCA design choices, and
is demonstrated to significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art exact
approaches available in the literature.

generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is proposed, to enhance the robustness
against both channel noise and transmission data distribution shifts. A
theoretical foundation is established using stochastic differential equations
(SDEs), from which a closed-form mapping between any signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) and the optimal denoising timestep is derived. Moreover, to address
distribution mismatch, a mathematical scaling method is introduced to align
received semantic features with the training distribution of the GAI. Built on
this theoretical foundation, a latent diffusion model (LDM)-based semantic
communication framework is proposed that combines a variational autoencoder for
semantic features extraction, where a pretrained diffusion model is used for
denoising. The proposed system is a training-free framework that supports
zero-shot generalization, and achieves superior performance under low-SNR and
out-of-distribution conditions, offering a scalable and robust solution for
future 6G semantic communication systems. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed semantic communication framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both pixel-level accuracy and semantic perceptual quality,
consistently outperforming baselines across a wide range of SNRs and data
distributions without any fine-tuning or post-training.

                                        <span>  Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease affecting 35% of
extremely low birth weight infants. Defined by oxygen dependence at 36 weeks
postmenstrual age, it causes lifelong respiratory complications. However,
preventive interventions carry severe risks, including neurodevelopmental
impairment, ventilator-induced lung injury, and systemic complications.
Therefore, early BPD prognosis and prediction of BPD outcome is crucial to
avoid unnecessary toxicity in low risk infants. Admission radiographs of
extremely preterm infants are routinely acquired within 24h of life and could
serve as a non-invasive prognostic tool. In this work, we developed and
investigated a deep learning approach using chest X-rays from 163 extremely
low-birth-weight infants ($\leq$32 weeks gestation, 401-999g) obtained within
24 hours of birth. We fine-tuned a ResNet-50 pretrained specifically on adult
chest radiographs, employing progressive layer freezing with discriminative
learning rates to prevent overfitting and evaluated a CutMix augmentation and
linear probing. For moderate/severe BPD outcome prediction, our best performing
model with progressive freezing, linear probing and CutMix achieved an AUROC of
0.78 $\pm$ 0.10, balanced accuracy of 0.69 $\pm$ 0.10, and an F1-score of 0.67
$\pm$ 0.11. In-domain pre-training significantly outperformed ImageNet
initialization (p = 0.031) which confirms domain-specific pretraining to be
important for BPD outcome prediction. Routine IRDS grades showed limited
prognostic value (AUROC 0.57 $\pm$ 0.11), confirming the need of learned
markers. Our approach demonstrates that domain-specific pretraining enables
accurate BPD prediction from routine day-1 radiographs. Through progressive
freezing and linear probing, the method remains computationally feasible for
site-level implementation and future federated learning deployments.

                                        <span>  The standard approach to causal modelling especially in social and health
sciences is the potential outcomes framework due to Neyman and Rubin. In this
framework, observations are thought to be drawn from a distribution over
variables of interest, and the goal is to identify parameters of this
distribution. Even though the stated goal is often to inform decision making on
some target population, there is no straightforward way to include these target
populations in the framework. Instead of modelling the relationship between the
observed sample and the target population, the inductive assumptions in this
framework take the form of abstract sampling and independence assumptions. In
this paper, we develop a version of this framework that construes causal
inference as treatment-wise predictions for finite populations where all
assumptions are testable in retrospect; this means that one can not only test
predictions themselves (without any fundamental problem) but also investigate
sources of error when they fail. Due to close connections to the original
framework, established methods can still be be analysed under the new
framework.

                                        <span>  This paper introduces a dataset that is the result of a user study on the
comprehensibility of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) algorithms. The
study participants were recruited from 149 candidates to form three groups
representing experts in the domain of mycology (DE), students with a data
science and visualization background (IT) and students from social sciences and
humanities (SSH). The main part of the dataset contains 39 transcripts of
interviews during which participants were asked to complete a series of tasks
and questions related to the interpretation of explanations of decisions of a
machine learning model trained to distinguish between edible and inedible
mushrooms. The transcripts were complemented with additional data that includes
visualizations of explanations presented to the user, results from thematic
analysis, recommendations of improvements of explanations provided by the
participants, and the initial survey results that allow to determine the domain
knowledge of the participant and data analysis literacy. The transcripts were
manually tagged to allow for automatic matching between the text and other data
related to particular fragments. In the advent of the area of rapid development
of XAI techniques, the need for a multidisciplinary qualitative evaluation of
explainability is one of the emerging topics in the community. Our dataset
allows not only to reproduce the study we conducted, but also to open a wide
range of possibilities for the analysis of the material we gathered.

                                        <span>  To alleviate the reliance of deep neural networks on large-scale datasets,
dataset distillation aims to generate compact, high-quality synthetic datasets
that can achieve comparable performance to the original dataset. The
integration of generative models has significantly advanced this field.
However, existing approaches primarily focus on aligning the distilled dataset
with the original one, often overlooking task-specific information that can be
critical for optimal downstream performance. In this paper, focusing on the
downstream task of classification, we propose a task-specific sampling strategy
for generative dataset distillation that incorporates the concept of difficulty
to consider the requirements of the target task better. The final dataset is
sampled from a larger image pool with a sampling distribution obtained by
matching the difficulty distribution of the original dataset. A logarithmic
transformation is applied as a pre-processing step to correct for
distributional bias. The results of extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method and suggest its potential for enhancing performance
on other downstream tasks. The code is available at

                                        <span>  Machine Learning research, including work promoting fair or equitable
algorithms, heavily relies on the concept of a data-generating probability
distribution. The standard presumption is that since data points are 'sampled
from' such a distribution, one can learn from observed data about this
distribution and, thus, predict future data points which are also drawn from
it. We argue, however, that such true probability distributions do not exist
and should not be dealt with uncritically. We show that alternative frameworks
focusing directly on relevant populations rather than abstract distributions
are available and leave classical learning theory almost unchanged.
Furthermore, we argue that the assumption of true probabilities or
data-generating distributions can be misleading and obscure both the choices
made and the goals pursued in machine learning practice. Based on these
considerations, this position paper argues that, at least in social settings,
machine learning work should avoid assuming data-generating probability
distributions.

conventional deterministic logits with diagonal Gaussian-distributed logits.
Our method simultaneously addresses temperature scaling and manifold
approximation by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the
predicted Gaussian distributions and a unit isotropic Gaussian. This unifies
uncertainty calibration and latent control in a principled probabilistic
manner, enabling a natural interpretation of class confidence and geometric
consistency. Experiments on CIFAR-10 show that ZClassifier improves over
softmax classifiers in robustness, calibration, and latent separation.

research area, with numerous studies demonstrating that quantum machine
learning (QML) is expected to solve scientific problems more effectively than
classical ML. In this work, we present Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM),
a QML architecture, and demonstrate its effectiveness in drug discovery. We
evaluate QLSTM on five benchmark datasets (BBBP, BACE, SIDER, BCAP37, T-47D),
and observe consistent performance gains over classical LSTM, with ROC-AUC
improvements ranging from 3% to over 6%. Furthermore, QLSTM exhibits improved
predictive accuracy as the number of qubits increases, and faster convergence
than classical LSTM under the same training conditions. Notably, QLSTM
maintains strong robustness against quantum computer noise, outperforming
noise-free classical LSTM in certain settings. These findings highlight the
potential of QLSTM as a scalable and noise-resilient model for scientific
applications, particularly as quantum hardware continues to advance in qubit
capacity and fidelity.

                                        <span>  This paper introduces Q-learning with gradient target tracking, a novel
reinforcement learning framework that provides a learned continuous target
update mechanism as an alternative to the conventional hard update paradigm. In
the standard deep Q-network (DQN), the target network is a copy of the online
network's weights, held fixed for a number of iterations before being
periodically replaced via a hard update. While this stabilizes training by
providing consistent targets, it introduces a new challenge: the hard update
period must be carefully tuned to achieve optimal performance. To address this
issue, we propose two gradient-based target update methods: DQN with asymmetric
gradient target tracking (AGT2-DQN) and DQN with symmetric gradient target
tracking (SGT2-DQN). These methods replace the conventional hard target updates
with continuous and structured updates using gradient descent, which
effectively eliminates the need for manual tuning. We provide a theoretical
analysis proving the convergence of these methods in tabular settings.
Additionally, empirical evaluations demonstrate their advantages over standard
DQN baselines, which suggest that gradient-based target updates can serve as an
effective alternative to conventional target update mechanisms in Q-learning.

                                        <span>  Many physical systems are described by partial differential equations (PDEs),
and solving these equations and estimating their coefficients or boundary
conditions (BCs) from observational data play a crucial role in understanding
the associated phenomena. Recently, a machine learning approach known as
physics-informed neural network, which solves PDEs using neural networks by
minimizing the sum of residuals from the PDEs, BCs, and data, has gained
significant attention in the scientific community. In this study, we
investigate a physics-informed linear model (PILM) that uses linear
combinations of basis functions to represent solutions, thereby enabling an
analytical representation of optimal solutions. The PILM was formulated and
verified for illustrative forward and inverse problems including cases with
uncertain BCs. Furthermore, the PILM was applied to estimate crustal strain
rates using geodetic data. Specifically, physical regularization that enforces
elastic equilibrium on the velocity fields was compared with mathematical
regularization that imposes smoothness constraints. From a Bayesian
perspective, mathematical regularization exhibited superior performance. The
PILM provides an analytically solvable framework applicable to linear forward
and inverse problems, underdetermined systems, and physical regularization.

                                        <span>  Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable code generation capabilities
but falter when adapting to frequent updates in external library APIs. This
critical limitation, stemming from reliance on outdated API knowledge from
their training data, even with access to current documentation, impedes
reliable code generation in dynamic environments. To tackle this issue, we
propose ReCode (rule-based Reinforcement learning for Code Update), a novel
framework that mimics human programmer adaptation to API changes. Specifically,
we construct a dataset of approximately 2,000 data entries to train the LLMs to
perform version migration based on updated information. Then, we introduce a
modified string similarity metric for code evaluation as the reward for
reinforcement learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ReCode substantially
boosts LLMs' code generation performance in dynamic API scenarios, especially
on the unseen CodeUpdateArena task. Crucially, compared to supervised
fine-tuning, ReCode has less impact on LLMs' general code generation abilities.
We apply ReCode on various LLMs and reinforcement learning algorithms (GRPO and
DAPO), all achieving consistent improvements. Notably, after training,
Qwen2.5-Coder-7B outperforms that of the 32B parameter code instruction-tuned
model and the reasoning model with the same architecture. Code is available at

                                        <span>  Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has shown promise in
aligning large language models (LLMs). Yet its reliance on a singular reward
model often overlooks the diversity of human preferences. Recent approaches
address this limitation by leveraging multi-dimensional feedback to fine-tune
corresponding reward models and train LLMs using reinforcement learning.
However, the process is costly and unstable, especially given the competing and
heterogeneous nature of human preferences. In this paper, we propose Mixing
Preference Optimization (MPO), a post-processing framework for aggregating
single-objective policies as an alternative to both multi-objective RLHF
(MORLHF) and MaxMin-RLHF. MPO avoids alignment from scratch. Instead, it
log-linearly combines existing policies into a unified one with the weight of
each policy computed via a batch stochastic mirror descent. Empirical results
demonstrate that MPO achieves balanced performance across diverse preferences,
outperforming or matching existing models with significantly reduced
computational costs.

dynamics network to predict the environment dynamics for planning, without
relying on simulators. However, the latent states learned by the dynamics
network make its planning process opaque. This paper aims to demystify MuZero's
model by interpreting the learned latent states. We incorporate observation
reconstruction and state consistency into MuZero training and conduct an
in-depth analysis to evaluate latent states across two board games: 9x9 Go and
Gomoku, and three Atari games: Breakout, Ms. Pacman, and Pong. Our findings
reveal that while the dynamics network becomes less accurate over longer
simulations, MuZero still performs effectively by using planning to correct
errors. Our experiments also show that the dynamics network learns better
latent states in board games than in Atari games. These insights contribute to
a better understanding of MuZero and offer directions for future research to
improve the performance, robustness, and interpretability of the MuZero
algorithm. The code and data are available at

personalized images by providing a text prompt and a random Gaussian noise.
While people observe that some noises are ``golden noises'' that can achieve
better text-image alignment and higher human preference than others, we still
lack a machine learning framework to obtain those golden noises. To learn
golden noises for diffusion sampling, we mainly make three contributions in
this paper. First, we identify a new concept termed the \textit{noise prompt},
which aims at turning a random Gaussian noise into a golden noise by adding a
small desirable perturbation derived from the text prompt. Following the
concept, we first formulate the \textit{noise prompt learning} framework that
systematically learns ``prompted'' golden noise associated with a text prompt
for diffusion models. Second, we design a noise prompt data collection pipeline
and collect a large-scale \textit{noise prompt dataset}~(NPD) that contains
100k pairs of random noises and golden noises with the associated text prompts.
With the prepared NPD as the training dataset, we trained a small \textit{noise
prompt network}~(NPNet) that can directly learn to transform a random noise
into a golden noise. The learned golden noise perturbation can be considered as
a kind of prompt for noise, as it is rich in semantic information and tailored
to the given text prompt. Third, our extensive experiments demonstrate the
impressive effectiveness and generalization of NPNet on improving the quality
of synthesized images across various diffusion models, including SDXL,
DreamShaper-xl-v2-turbo, and Hunyuan-DiT. Moreover, NPNet is a small and
efficient controller that acts as a plug-and-play module with very limited
additional inference and computational costs, as it just provides a golden
noise instead of a random noise without accessing the original pipeline.

graphs provide rich historical information and have the powerful attacks
historic correlation ability to identify anomalous activities, TBDetector
employs provenance analysis for APT detection, which summarizes long-running
system execution with space efficiency and utilizes transformer with
self-attention based encoder-decoder to extract long-term contextual features
of system states to detect slow-acting attacks. Furthermore, we further
introduce anomaly scores to investigate the anomaly of different system states,
where each state is calculated with an anomaly score corresponding to its

                                        <span>  This work suggests faster and space-efficient index construction algorithms
for LSH for Euclidean distance (\textit{a.k.a.}~\ELSH) and cosine similarity
(\textit{a.k.a.}~\SRP). The index construction step of these LSHs relies on
grouping data points into several bins of hash tables based on their hashcode.
To generate an $m$-dimensional hashcode of the $d$-dimensional data point,
these LSHs first project the data point onto a $d$-dimensional random Gaussian
vector and then discretise the resulting inner product. The time and space
complexity of both \ELSH~and \SRP~for computing an $m$-sized hashcode of a
$d$-dimensional vector is $O(md)$, which becomes impractical for large values
of $m$ and $d$. To overcome this problem, we propose two alternative LSH
hashcode generation algorithms, both for Euclidean distance and cosine
similarity, namely, \CSELSH, \HCSELSH~and \CSSRP, \HCSSRP, respectively.
\CSELSH~and \CSSRP~are based on count sketch \cite{count_sketch} and
\HCSELSH~and \HCSSRP~utilize higher-order count sketch \cite{shi2019higher}.
These proposals significantly reduce the hashcode computation time from $O(md)$
to $O(d)$. Additionally, both \CSELSH~and \CSSRP~reduce the space complexity
from $O(md)$ to $O(d)$; ~and \HCSELSH, \HCSSRP~ reduce the space complexity
from $O(md)$ to $O(N \sqrt[N]{d})$ respectively, where $N\geq 1$ denotes the
size of the input/reshaped tensor. Our proposals are backed by strong
mathematical guarantees, and we validate their performance through simulations
on various real-world datasets.

real-world applications such as healthcare, finance, and education. However,
its effective use in machine learning is often constrained by data scarcity,
privacy concerns, and class imbalance. Synthetic tabular data generation has
emerged as a powerful solution, leveraging generative models to learn
underlying data distributions and produce realistic, privacy-preserving
samples. Although this area has seen growing attention, most existing surveys
focus narrowly on specific methods (e.g., GANs or privacy-enhancing
techniques), lacking a unified and comprehensive view that integrates recent
advances such as diffusion models and large language models (LLMs).
  In this survey, we present a structured and in-depth review of synthetic
tabular data generation methods. Specifically, the survey is organized into
three core components: (1) Background, which covers the overall generation
pipeline, including problem definitions, synthetic tabular data generation
methods, post processing, and evaluation; (2) Generation Methods, where we
categorize existing approaches into traditional generation methods, diffusion
model methods, and LLM-based methods, and compare them in terms of
architecture, generation quality, and applicability; and (3) Applications and
Challenges, which summarizes practical use cases, highlights common datasets,
and discusses open challenges such as heterogeneity, data fidelity, and privacy
protection.
  This survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a holistic
understanding of the field and to highlight key directions for future work in
synthetic tabular data generation.

                                        <span>  Human mobility modeling is critical for urban planning and transportation
management, yet existing approaches often lack the integration capabilities
needed to handle diverse data sources. We present a foundation model framework
for universal human mobility patterns that leverages cross-domain data fusion
and large language models to address these limitations. Our approach integrates
multi-modal data of distinct nature and spatio-temporal resolution, including
geographical, mobility, socio-demographic, and traffic information, to
construct a privacy-preserving and semantically enriched human travel
trajectory dataset. Our framework demonstrates adaptability through domain
transfer techniques that ensure transferability across diverse urban contexts,
as evidenced in case studies of Los Angeles (LA) and Egypt. The framework
employs LLMs for semantic enrichment of trajectory data, enabling comprehensive
understanding of mobility patterns. Quantitative evaluation shows that our
generated synthetic dataset accurately reproduces mobility patterns observed in
empirical data. The practical utility of this foundation model approach is
demonstrated through large-scale traffic simulations for LA County, where
results align well with observed traffic data. On California's I-405 corridor,
the simulation yields a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 5.85% for traffic
volume and 4.36% for speed compared to Caltrans PeMS observations, illustrating
the framework's potential for intelligent transportation systems and urban
mobility applications.

                                        <span>  In recent years, contrastive learning has achieved state-of-the-art
performance in the territory of self-supervised representation learning. Many
previous works have attempted to provide the theoretical understanding
underlying the success of contrastive learning. Almost all of them rely on a
default assumption, i.e., the label consistency assumption, which may not hold
in practice (the probability of failure is called labeling error) due to the
strength and randomness of common augmentation strategies, such as random
resized crop (RRC). This paper investigates the theoretical impact of labeling
error on the downstream classification performance of contrastive learning. We
first reveal several significant negative impacts of labeling error on
downstream classification risk. To mitigate these impacts, data dimensionality
reduction method (e.g., singular value decomposition, SVD) is applied on
original data to reduce false positive samples, and establish both theoretical
and empirical evaluations. Moreover, it is also found that SVD acts as a
double-edged sword, which may lead to the deterioration of downstream
classification accuracy due to the reduced connectivity of the augmentation
graph. Based on the above observations, we give the augmentation suggestion
that we should use some moderate embedding dimension (such as $512, 1024$ in
our experiments), data inflation, weak augmentation, and SVD to ensure large
graph connectivity and small labeling error to improve model performance.

are susceptible to anomalies that can significantly impact their performance
and reliability. This paper addresses the critical challenges of anomaly
detection, root cause localization, and anomaly type classification in
dynamical systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We define
two categories of anomalies: cyber anomalies, which propagate through
interconnected variables, and measurement anomalies, which remain localized to
individual variables. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable
Causality Ordinary Differential Equation (ICODE) Networks, a model-intrinsic
explainable learning framework. ICODE leverages Neural ODEs for anomaly
detection while employing causality inference through an explanation channel to
perform root cause analysis (RCA), elucidating why specific time periods are
flagged as anomalous. ICODE is designed to simultaneously perform anomaly
detection, RCA, and anomaly type classification within a single, interpretable
framework. Our approach is grounded in the hypothesis that anomalies alter the
underlying ODEs of the system, manifesting as changes in causal relationships
between variables. We provide a theoretical analysis of how perturbations in
learned model parameters can be utilized to identify anomalies and their root
causes in time series data. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate
the efficacy of ICODE across various dynamical systems, showcasing its ability
to accurately detect anomalies, classify their types, and pinpoint their
origins.

with webpages by sending commands to a virtual keyboard and mouse. While such
agents have considerable potential to assist human users with complex tasks,
evaluating their capabilities in real-world settings poses a major challenge.
To this end, we introduce BEARCUBS, a "small but mighty" benchmark of 111
information-seeking questions designed to evaluate a web agent's ability to
search, browse, and identify factual information from the web. Unlike prior web
agent benchmarks, solving BEARCUBS requires (1) accessing live web content
rather than synthetic or simulated pages, which captures the unpredictability
of real-world web interactions; and (2) performing a broad range of multimodal
interactions (e.g., video understanding, 3D navigation) that cannot be bypassed
via text-based workarounds. Each question in BEARCUBS has a corresponding
short, unambiguous answer and a human-validated browsing trajectory, allowing
for transparent evaluation of agent performance and strategies. A human study
confirms that BEARCUBS questions are solvable but non-trivial (84.7% human
accuracy), revealing domain knowledge gaps and overlooked details as common
failure points. By contrast, state-of-the-art computer-using agents
underperform, with the best-scoring system (OpenAI's Operator) reaching only
23.4% accuracy. These results highlight critical areas for improvement,
including reliable source selection and more powerful multimodal capabilities.
To facilitate future research, BEARCUBS will be updated periodically to replace
invalid or contaminated questions, keeping the benchmark fresh for future
generations of web agents.

                                        <span>  Inductive bias is a key factor in spatial regression models, determining how
well a model can learn from limited data and capture spatial patterns. This
work revisits the inductive biases in Geographically Neural Network Weighted
Regression (GNNWR) and identifies limitations in current approaches for
modeling spatial non-stationarity. While GNNWR extends traditional
Geographically Weighted Regression by using neural networks to learn spatial
weighting functions, existing implementations are often restricted by fixed
distance-based schemes and limited inductive bias. We propose to generalize
GNNWR by incorporating concepts from convolutional neural networks, recurrent
neural networks, and transformers, introducing local receptive fields,
sequential context, and self-attention into spatial regression. Through
extensive benchmarking on synthetic spatial datasets with varying
heterogeneity, noise, and sample sizes, we show that GNNWR outperforms classic
methods in capturing nonlinear and complex spatial relationships. Our results
also reveal that model performance depends strongly on data characteristics,
with local models excelling in highly heterogeneous or small-sample scenarios,
and global models performing better with larger, more homogeneous data. These
findings highlight the importance of inductive bias in spatial modeling and
suggest future directions, including learnable spatial weighting functions,
hybrid neural architectures, and improved interpretability for models handling
non-stationary spatial data.

                                        <span>  Graph pooling, which compresses a whole graph into a smaller coarsened graph,
is an essential component of graph representation learning. To efficiently
compress a given graph, graph pooling methods often drop their nodes with
attention-based scoring with the task loss. However, this often results in
simply removing nodes with lower degrees without consideration of their
feature-level relevance to the given task. To fix this problem, we propose a
Multi-View Pruning(MVP), a graph pruning method based on a multi-view framework
and reconstruction loss. Given a graph, MVP first constructs multiple graphs
for different views either by utilizing the predefined modalities or by
randomly partitioning the input features, to consider the importance of each
node in diverse perspectives. Then, it learns the score for each node by
considering both the reconstruction and the task loss. MVP can be incorporated
with any hierarchical pooling framework to score the nodes. We validate MVP on
multiple benchmark datasets by coupling it with two graph pooling methods, and
show that it significantly improves the performance of the base graph pooling
method, outperforming all baselines. Further analysis shows that both the
encoding of multiple views and the consideration of reconstruction loss are the
key to the success of MVP, and that it indeed identifies nodes that are less
important according to domain knowledge.

models remain vulnerable to fine-tuning on poisoned data, even when safeguarded
by moderation systems. Given the persistence of data poisoning vulnerabilities
in today's most capable models, this paper investigates whether these risks
increase with model scaling. We evaluate three threat models -- malicious
fine-tuning, imperfect data curation, and intentional data contamination --
across 24 frontier LLMs ranging from 1.5 to 72 billion parameters. Our
experiments reveal that larger LLMs are significantly more susceptible to data
poisoning, learning harmful behaviors from even minimal exposure to harmful
data more quickly than smaller models. These findings underscore the need for
leading AI companies to thoroughly red team fine-tuning APIs before public
release and to develop more robust safeguards against data poisoning,
particularly as models continue to scale in size and capability.

frames can significantly improve the performance of Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs). Current methods, such as reducing inter-frame redundancy,
employing separate models for image-text relevance assessment, or utilizing
temporal video grounding for event localization, substantially adopt
unsupervised learning paradigms, whereas they struggle to address the complex
scenarios in long video understanding. We propose Instructed Temporal Grounding
for Videos (VideoITG), featuring customized frame sampling aligned with user
instructions. The core of VideoITG is the VidThinker pipeline, an automated
annotation framework that explicitly mimics the human annotation process.
First, it generates detailed clip-level captions conditioned on the
instruction; then, it retrieves relevant video segments through
instruction-guided reasoning; finally, it performs fine-grained frame selection
to pinpoint the most informative visual evidence. Leveraging VidThinker, we
construct the VideoITG-40K dataset, containing 40K videos and 500K instructed
temporal grounding annotations. We then design a plug-and-play VideoITG model,
which takes advantage of visual language alignment and reasoning capabilities
of Video-LLMs, for effective frame selection in a discriminative manner.
Coupled with Video-LLMs, VideoITG achieves consistent performance improvements
across multiple multimodal video understanding benchmarks, showing its
superiority and great potentials for video understanding.

                                        <span>  Flow matching has emerged as a compelling generative modeling approach that
is widely used across domains. To generate data via a flow matching model, an
ordinary differential equation (ODE) is numerically solved via forward
integration of the modeled velocity field. To better capture the multi-modality
that is inherent in typical velocity fields, hierarchical flow matching was
recently introduced. It uses a hierarchy of ODEs that are numerically
integrated when generating data. This hierarchy of ODEs captures the
multi-modal velocity distribution just like vanilla flow matching is capable of
modeling a multi-modal data distribution. While this hierarchy enables to model
multi-modal velocity distributions, the complexity of the modeled distribution
remains identical across levels of the hierarchy. In this paper, we study how
to gradually adjust the complexity of the distributions across different levels
of the hierarchy via mini-batch couplings. We show the benefits of mini-batch
couplings in hierarchical rectified flow matching via compelling results on
synthetic and imaging data. Code is available at

                                        <span>  Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved
performance by increasing the number of visual tokens, which are often
significantly longer than text tokens. However, we observe that most real-world
scenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the
performance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models
still perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4
resolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with
different resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression,
namely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides
whether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output
a special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing
Efficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or
thresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by
case. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding

on simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge
strategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully
design a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and
reasonable image resize call ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate the

approach to visual geometry reconstruction, breaking the reliance on a
conventional fixed reference view. Previous methods often anchor their
reconstructions to a designated viewpoint, an inductive bias that can lead to
instability and failures if the reference is suboptimal. In contrast, $\pi^3$
employs a fully permutation-equivariant architecture to predict
affine-invariant camera poses and scale-invariant local point maps without any
reference frames. This design makes our model inherently robust to input
ordering and highly scalable. These advantages enable our simple and bias-free
approach to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks,
including camera pose estimation, monocular/video depth estimation, and dense
point map reconstruction. Code and models are publicly available.

in an autoregressive manner. This model can take as input an image of an
object, 2D masks of the object's parts, or an existing 3D object, and generate
a corresponding compositional 3D reconstruction. Our approach builds upon
3DShape2VecSet, a recent latent 3D representation with powerful geometric
expressiveness. We observe that this latent space exhibits strong compositional
properties, making it particularly well-suited for part-based generation tasks.
Specifically, AutoPartGen generates object parts autoregressively, predicting
one part at a time while conditioning on previously generated parts and
additional inputs, such as 2D images, masks, or 3D objects. This process
continues until the model decides that all parts have been generated, thus
determining automatically the type and number of parts. The resulting parts can
be seamlessly assembled into coherent objects or scenes without requiring
additional optimization. We evaluate both the overall 3D generation
capabilities and the part-level generation quality of AutoPartGen,
demonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D part
generation.

                                        <span>  This paper addresses the challenge of high-fidelity view synthesis of humans
with sparse-view videos as input. Previous methods solve the issue of
insufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos
at novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack
spatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this
paper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the
spatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define
a latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human
pose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the
latent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and
finally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised
latents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across
the latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field
and thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory
consumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ
datasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and
consistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing
approaches. See our project page for interactive demos and video results:

generation tasks, but their high computational cost makes them impractical for
resource-constrained devices like smartphones, and real-time generation is even
more challenging. In this work, we propose a series of novel optimizations to
significantly accelerate video generation and enable real-time performance on
mobile platforms. First, we employ a highly compressed variational autoencoder
(VAE) to reduce the dimensionality of the input data without sacrificing visual
quality. Second, we introduce a KD-guided, sensitivity-aware tri-level pruning
strategy to shrink the model size to suit mobile platform while preserving
critical performance characteristics. Third, we develop an adversarial step
distillation technique tailored for DiT, which allows us to reduce the number
of inference steps to four. Combined, these optimizations enable our model to
achieve over 10 frames per second (FPS) generation on an iPhone 16 Pro Max,
demonstrating the feasibility of real-time, high-quality video generation on
mobile devices.

applications such as remote sensing and medical imaging, yet HSI sensors
inherently trade spatial detail for spectral richness. Fusing
high-spatial-resolution multispectral images (HR-MSI) with
low-spatial-resolution hyperspectral images (LR-HSI) is a promising route to
recover fine spatial structures without sacrificing spectral fidelity. Most
state-of-the-art methods for HSI-MSI fusion demand point spread function (PSF)
calibration or ground truth high resolution HSI (HR-HSI), both of which are
impractical to obtain in real world settings. We present SpectraLift, a fully
self-supervised framework that fuses LR-HSI and HR-MSI inputs using only the
MSI's Spectral Response Function (SRF). SpectraLift trains a lightweight
per-pixel multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network using ($i$)~a synthetic
low-spatial-resolution multispectral image (LR-MSI) obtained by applying the
SRF to the LR-HSI as input, ($ii$)~the LR-HSI as the output, and ($iii$)~an
$\ell_1$ spectral reconstruction loss between the estimated and true LR-HSI as
the optimization objective. At inference, SpectraLift uses the trained network
to map the HR-MSI pixel-wise into a HR-HSI estimate. SpectraLift converges in
minutes, is agnostic to spatial blur and resolution, and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on PSNR, SAM, SSIM, and RMSE benchmarks.

                                        <span>  Hand-object interaction detection remains an open challenge in real-time
applications, where intuitive user experiences depend on fast and accurate
detection of interactions with surrounding objects. We propose an efficient
approach for detecting hand-objects interactions from streaming egocentric
vision that operates in real time. Our approach consists of an action
recognition module and an object detection module for identifying active
objects upon confirmed interaction. Our Mamba model with EfficientNetV2 as
backbone for action recognition achieves 38.52% p-AP on the ENIGMA-51 benchmark
at 30fps, while our fine-tuned YOLOWorld reaches 85.13% AP for hand and object.
We implement our models in a cascaded architecture where the action recognition
and object detection modules operate sequentially. When the action recognition
predicts a contact state, it activates the object detection module, which in
turn performs inference on the relevant frame to detect and classify the active
object.

                                        <span>  The reasoning-based pose estimation (RPE) benchmark has emerged as a widely
adopted evaluation standard for pose-aware multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Despite its significance, we identified critical reproducibility and
benchmark-quality issues that hinder fair and consistent quantitative
evaluations. Most notably, the benchmark utilizes different image indices from
those of the original 3DPW dataset, forcing researchers into tedious and
error-prone manual matching processes to obtain accurate ground-truth (GT)
annotations for quantitative metrics (\eg, MPJPE, PA-MPJPE). Furthermore, our
analysis reveals several inherent benchmark-quality limitations, including
significant image redundancy, scenario imbalance, overly simplistic poses, and
ambiguous textual descriptions, collectively undermining reliable evaluations
across diverse scenarios. To alleviate manual effort and enhance
reproducibility, we carefully refined the GT annotations through meticulous
visual matching and publicly release these refined annotations as an
open-source resource, thereby promoting consistent quantitative evaluations and
facilitating future advancements in human pose-aware multimodal reasoning.

e-commerce, where users expect personalized previews under diverse poses and
lighting conditions. Existing methods often rely on predefined poses, limiting
semantic flexibility and illumination adaptability. To address this, we
introduce FashionPose, the first unified text-to-pose-to-relighting generation
framework. Given a natural language description, our method first predicts a 2D
human pose, then employs a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity person
images, and finally applies a lightweight relighting module, all guided by the
same textual input. By replacing explicit pose annotations with text-driven
conditioning, FashionPose enables accurate pose alignment, faithful garment
rendering, and flexible lighting control. Experiments demonstrate fine-grained
pose synthesis and efficient, consistent relighting, providing a practical
solution for personalized virtual fashion display.

However, accurate age estimation can be confounded by several factors,
including facial makeup that can induce changes to alter perceived identity and
age to fool both humans and machines. In this work, we propose DiffClean which

Vision Transformers (ViT) involves freezing the majority of the backbone
parameters and solely learning low-rank adaptation weight matrices to
accommodate downstream tasks. These low-rank matrices are commonly derived
through the multiplication structure of down-projection and up-projection
matrices, exemplified by methods such as LoRA and Adapter. In this work, we
observe an approximate orthogonality among any two row or column vectors within
any weight matrix of the backbone parameters; however, this property is absent
in the vectors of the down/up-projection matrices. Approximate orthogonality
implies a reduction in the upper bound of the model's generalization error,
signifying that the model possesses enhanced generalization capability. If the
fine-tuned down/up-projection matrices were to exhibit this same property as
the pre-trained backbone matrices, could the generalization capability of
fine-tuned ViTs be further augmented? To address this question, we propose an
Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (AOFT) strategy for representing the
low-rank weight matrices. This strategy employs a single learnable vector to
generate a set of approximately orthogonal vectors, which form the
down/up-projection matrices, thereby aligning the properties of these matrices
with those of the backbone. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves competitive performance across a range of downstream image
classification tasks, confirming the efficacy of the enhanced generalization
capability embedded in the down/up-projection matrices.

                                        <span>  We present VITA, a Vision-To-Action flow matching policy that evolves latent
visual representations into latent actions for visuomotor control. Traditional
flow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions
(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like
cross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating
time and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent
images as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action
while eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative
modeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different
modalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data
lacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional
visual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a
structured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,
up-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we
supervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs
through flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss
through sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end
learning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging
bi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and
2 real-world tasks. Despite its simplicity, MLP-only VITA outperforms or
matches state-of-the-art generative policies while reducing inference latency
by 50-130% compared to conventional flow matching policies requiring different
conditioning mechanisms or complex architectures. To our knowledge, VITA is the
first MLP-only flow matching policy capable of solving complex bi-manual
manipulation tasks like those in ALOHA benchmarks.

                                        <span>  The pursuit of a generalizable stereo matching model, capable of performing
across varying resolutions and disparity ranges without dataset-specific
fine-tuning, has revealed a fundamental trade-off. Iterative local search
methods achieve high scores on constrained benchmarks, but their core mechanism
inherently limits the global consistency required for true generalization. On
the other hand, global matching architectures, while theoretically more robust,
have been historically rendered infeasible by prohibitive computational and
memory costs. We resolve this dilemma with $S^2M^2$: a global matching
architecture that achieves both state-of-the-art accuracy and high efficiency
without relying on cost volume filtering or deep refinement stacks. Our design
integrates a multi-resolution transformer for robust long-range correspondence,
trained with a novel loss function that concentrates probability on feasible
matches. This approach enables a more robust joint estimation of disparity,
occlusion, and confidence. $S^2M^2$ establishes a new state of the art on the
Middlebury v3 and ETH3D benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior methods
across most metrics while reconstructing high-quality details with competitive
efficiency.

                                        <span>  Recent advances in Generative AI (GenAI) have led to significant improvements
in the quality of generated visual content. As AI-generated visual content
becomes increasingly indistinguishable from real content, the challenge of
detecting the generated content becomes critical in combating misinformation,
ensuring privacy, and preventing security threats. Although there has been
substantial progress in detecting AI-generated images, current methods for
video detection are largely focused on deepfakes, which primarily involve human
faces. However, the field of video generation has advanced beyond DeepFakes,
creating an urgent need for methods capable of detecting AI-generated videos
with generic content. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that
leverages pre-trained visual models to distinguish between real and generated
videos. The features extracted from these pre-trained models, which have been
trained on extensive real visual content, contain inherent signals that can
help distinguish real from generated videos. Using these extracted features, we
achieve high detection performance without requiring additional model training,
and we further improve performance by training a simple linear classification
layer on top of the extracted features. We validated our method on a dataset we
compiled (VID-AID), which includes around 10,000 AI-generated videos produced
by 9 different text-to-video models, along with 4,000 real videos, totaling
over 7 hours of video content. Our evaluation shows that our approach achieves
high detection accuracy, above 90% on average, underscoring its effectiveness.
Upon acceptance, we plan to publicly release the code, the pre-trained models,
and our dataset to support ongoing research in this critical area.

enhanced visual AI's capabilities, the challenge of inadequate data diversity
and volume remains, particularly in construction domain. This study presents a
novel image synthesis methodology tailored for construction worker detection,
leveraging the generative-AI platform Midjourney. The approach entails
generating a collection of 12,000 synthetic images by formulating 3000
different prompts, with an emphasis on image realism and diversity. These
images, after manual labeling, serve as a dataset for DNN training. Evaluation
on a real construction image dataset yielded promising results, with the model
attaining average precisions (APs) of 0.937 and 0.642 at
intersection-over-union (IoU) thresholds of 0.5 and 0.5 to 0.95, respectively.
Notably, the model demonstrated near-perfect performance on the synthetic
dataset, achieving APs of 0.994 and 0.919 at the two mentioned thresholds.
These findings reveal both the potential and weakness of generative AI in
addressing DNN training data scarcity.

generation and generalization to challenging scenarios. In this work, we
develop a model using simple design choices, and without additional supervision
or sensors, such as maps, depth, or multiple cameras. We show that our model
yields state-of-the-art performance, despite having only 469M parameters and
being trained on 280h of video data. It particularly stands out in difficult
scenarios like turning maneuvers and urban traffic. We test whether discrete
token models possibly have advantages over continuous models based on flow
matching. To this end, we set up a hybrid tokenizer that is compatible with
both approaches and allows for a side-by-side comparison. Our study concludes
in favor of the continuous autoregressive model, which is less brittle on
individual design choices and more powerful than the model built on discrete
tokens. Code, models and qualitative results are publicly available at

emerging large language models (LLMs). These methods exhibited excellent
generalization capabilities in instruction understanding and task reasoning.
However, they were constrained by the fixed knowledge bases and reasoning
abilities of LLMs, preventing fully incorporating experiential knowledge and
thus resulting in a lack of efficient evolutionary capacity. To address this,
we drew inspiration from the evolution capabilities of natural agents, and
proposed a self-evolving VLN framework (SE-VLN) to endow VLN agents with the
ability to continuously evolve during testing. To the best of our knowledge, it
was the first time that an multimodal LLM-powered self-evolving VLN framework
was proposed. Specifically, SE-VLN comprised three core modules, i.e., a
hierarchical memory module to transfer successful and failure cases into
reusable knowledge, a retrieval-augmented thought-based reasoning module to
retrieve experience and enable multi-step decision-making, and a reflection
module to realize continual evolution. Comprehensive tests illustrated that the
SE-VLN achieved navigation success rates of 57% and 35.2% in unseen
environments, representing absolute performance improvements of 23.9% and 15.0%
over current state-of-the-art methods on R2R and REVERSE datasets,
respectively. Moreover, the SE-VLN showed performance improvement with
increasing experience repository, elucidating its great potential as a
self-evolving agent framework for VLN.

generation of pseudo-healthy baselines for tumor growth models and the
facilitation of image registration. In previous editions of the BraTS Local
Synthesis of Healthy Brain Tissue via Inpainting Challenge, denoising diffusion
probabilistic models (DDPMs) demonstrated qualitatively convincing results but
suffered from low sampling speed. To mitigate this limitation, we adapted a 2D
image generation approach, combining DDPMs with generative adversarial networks
(GANs) and employing a variance-preserving noise schedule, for the task of 3D
inpainting. Our experiments showed that the variance-preserving noise schedule
and the selected reconstruction losses can be effectively utilized for
high-quality 3D inpainting in a few time steps without requiring adversarial
training. We applied our findings to a different architecture, a 3D wavelet
diffusion model (WDM3D) that does not include a GAN component. The resulting
model, denoted as fastWDM3D, obtained a SSIM of 0.8571, a MSE of 0.0079, and a
PSNR of 22.26 on the BraTS inpainting test set. Remarkably, it achieved these
scores using only two time steps, completing the 3D inpainting process in 1.81
s per image. When compared to other DDPMs used for healthy brain tissue
inpainting, our model is up to 800 x faster while still achieving superior
performance metrics. Our proposed method, fastWDM3D, represents a promising
approach for fast and accurate healthy tissue inpainting. Our code is available

                                        <span>  Learning-based monocular visual odometry (VO) poses robustness,
generalization, and efficiency challenges in robotics. Recent advances in
visual foundation models, such as DINOv2, have improved robustness and
generalization in various vision tasks, yet their integration in VO remains
limited due to coarse feature granularity. In this paper, we present DINO-VO, a
feature-based VO system leveraging DINOv2 visual foundation model for its
sparse feature matching. To address the integration challenge, we propose a
salient keypoints detector tailored to DINOv2's coarse features. Furthermore,
we complement DINOv2's robust-semantic features with fine-grained geometric
features, resulting in more localizable representations. Finally, a
transformer-based matcher and differentiable pose estimation layer enable
precise camera motion estimation by learning good matches. Against prior
detector-descriptor networks like SuperPoint, DINO-VO demonstrates greater
robustness in challenging environments. Furthermore, we show superior accuracy
and generalization of the proposed feature descriptors against standalone
DINOv2 coarse features. DINO-VO outperforms prior frame-to-frame VO methods on
the TartanAir and KITTI datasets and is competitive on EuRoC dataset, while
running efficiently at 72 FPS with less than 1GB of memory usage on a single
GPU. Moreover, it performs competitively against Visual SLAM systems on outdoor
driving scenarios, showcasing its generalization capabilities.

                                        <span>  Detecting tiny objects in remote sensing (RS) imagery has been a
long-standing challenge due to their extremely limited spatial information,
weak feature representations, and dense distributions across complex
backgrounds. Despite numerous efforts devoted, mainstream detectors still
underperform in such scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce RS-TinyNet, a
multi-stage feature fusion and enhancement model explicitly tailored for RS
tiny object detection in various RS scenarios. RS-TinyNet comes with two novel
designs: tiny object saliency modeling and feature integrity reconstruction.
Guided by these principles, we design three step-wise feature enhancement
modules. Among them, the multi-dimensional collaborative attention (MDCA)
module employs multi-dimensional attention to enhance the saliency of tiny
objects. Additionally, the auxiliary reversible branch (ARB) and a progressive
fusion detection head (PFDH) module are introduced to preserve information flow
and fuse multi-level features to bridge semantic gaps and retain structural
detail. Comprehensive experiments on public RS dataset AI-TOD show that our
RS-TinyNet surpasses existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) detectors by 4.0% AP and
6.5% AP75. Evaluations on DIOR benchmark dataset further validate its superior
detection performance in diverse RS scenarios. These results demonstrate that
the proposed multi-stage feature fusion strategy offers an effective and
practical solution for tiny object detection in complex RS environments.

                                        <span>  IRSTD (InfraRed Small Target Detection) detects small targets in infrared
blurry backgrounds and is essential for various applications. The detection
task is challenging due to the small size of the targets and their sparse
distribution in infrared small target datasets. Although existing IRSTD methods
and datasets have led to significant advancements, they are limited by their
reliance solely on the image modality. Recent advances in deep learning and
large vision-language models have shown remarkable performance in various
visual recognition tasks. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal IRSTD
framework that incorporates language priors to guide small target detection. We
leverage language-guided attention weights derived from the language prior to
enhance the model's ability for IRSTD, presenting a novel approach that
combines textual information with image data to improve IRSTD capabilities.
Utilizing the state-of-the-art GPT-4 vision model, we generate text
descriptions that provide the locations of small targets in infrared images,
employing careful prompt engineering to ensure improved accuracy. Due to the
absence of multimodal IR datasets, existing IRSTD methods rely solely on image
data. To address this shortcoming, we have curated a multimodal infrared
dataset that includes both image and text modalities for small target
detection, expanding upon the popular IRSTD-1k and NUDT-SIRST datasets. We
validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments and
comprehensive ablation studies. The results demonstrate significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art method, with relative percentage
differences of 9.74%, 13.02%, 1.25%, and 67.87% in IoU, nIoU, Pd, and Fa on the
NUAA-SIRST subset, and 4.41%, 2.04%, 2.01%, and 113.43% on the IRSTD-1k subset
of the LangIR dataset, respectively.

                                        <span>  High-resolution 3D point clouds are highly effective for detecting subtle
structural anomalies in industrial inspection. However, their dense and
irregular nature imposes significant challenges, including high computational
cost, sensitivity to spatial misalignment, and difficulty in capturing
localized structural differences. This paper introduces a registration-based
anomaly detection framework that combines multi-prototype alignment with
cluster-wise discrepancy analysis to enable precise 3D anomaly localization.
Specifically, each test sample is first registered to multiple normal
prototypes to enable direct structural comparison. To evaluate anomalies at a
local level, clustering is performed over the point cloud, and similarity is
computed between features from the test sample and the prototypes within each
cluster. Rather than selecting cluster centroids randomly, a keypoint-guided
strategy is employed, where geometrically informative points are chosen as
centroids. This ensures that clusters are centered on feature-rich regions,
enabling more meaningful and stable distance-based comparisons. Extensive
experiments on the Real3D-AD benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both object-level and point-level
anomaly detection, even using only raw features.

user preferences. Existing approaches for continual visual concept learning are
constrained by two fundamental challenges: catastrophic forgetting and
parameter expansion. In this paper, we propose Redundancy-Removal Mixture of
Experts (R^2MoE), a parameter-efficient framework for lifelong visual concept
learning that effectively learns new concepts while incurring minimal parameter
overhead. Our framework includes three key innovative contributions: First, we
propose a mixture-of-experts framework with a routing distillation mechanism
that enables experts to acquire concept-specific knowledge while preserving the
gating network's routing capability, thereby effectively mitigating
catastrophic forgetting. Second, we propose a strategy for eliminating
redundant layer-wise experts that reduces the number of expert parameters by
fully utilizing previously learned experts. Third, we employ a hierarchical
local attention-guided inference approach to mitigate interference between
generated visual concepts. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our
method generates images with superior conceptual fidelity compared to the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, achieving an impressive 87.8\% reduction in
forgetting rates and 63.3\% fewer parameters on the CustomConcept 101 dataset.

and the need for post-natal intervention, especially for pregnancies affected
by fetal growth restriction. Intra-voxel incoherent motion analysis has shown
promising results for non-invasive assessment of fetal lung development, but
its reliance on manual segmentation is time-consuming, thus limiting its
clinical applicability. In this work, we present an automated lung maturity
evaluation pipeline for diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images that
consists of a deep learning-based fetal lung segmentation model and a
model-fitting lung maturity assessment. A 3D nnU-Net model was trained on
manually segmented images selected from the baseline frames of 4D
diffusion-weighted MRI scans. The segmentation model demonstrated robust
performance, yielding a mean Dice coefficient of 82.14%. Next, voxel-wise model
fitting was performed based on both the nnU-Net-predicted and manual lung
segmentations to quantify IVIM parameters reflecting tissue microstructure and
perfusion. The results suggested no differences between the two. Our work shows
that a fully automated pipeline is possible for supporting fetal lung maturity
assessment and clinical decision-making.

                                        <span>  Robust XAI techniques should ideally be simultaneously deterministic, model
agnostic, and guaranteed to converge. We propose MULTIDIMENSIONAL PROBLEM
AGNOSTIC EXPLAINABLE AI (MUPAX), a deterministic, model agnostic explainability
technique, with guaranteed convergency. MUPAX measure theoretic formulation
gives principled feature importance attribution through structured perturbation
analysis that discovers inherent input patterns and eliminates spurious
relationships. We evaluate MUPAX on an extensive range of data modalities and
tasks: audio classification (1D), image classification (2D), volumetric medical
image analysis (3D), and anatomical landmark detection, demonstrating dimension
agnostic effectiveness. The rigorous convergence guarantees extend to any loss
function and arbitrary dimensions, making MUPAX applicable to virtually any
problem context for AI. By contrast with other XAI methods that typically
decrease performance when masking, MUPAX not only preserves but actually
enhances model accuracy by capturing only the most important patterns of the
original data. Extensive benchmarking against the state of the XAI art
demonstrates MUPAX ability to generate precise, consistent and understandable
explanations, a crucial step towards explainable and trustworthy AI systems.
The source code will be released upon publication.

recognition ability and can be easily transferred to specific downstream tasks
via prompt tuning, even with limited training data. However, existing prompt
tuning methods face two main challenges: (1) In few-shot scenarios, data
scarcity often leads to overfitting, making the model sensitive to changes in
the input domain. (2) To mitigate overfitting, these methods typically rely on
complex task-specific model architectures and sensitive hyperparameter tuning,
severely restricting their general applicability. To address these issues, we
propose a simpler and more general framework called GLAD (Generalizable LoRA
tuning with RegulArized GraDient). We show that merely applying LoRA achieves
performance in downstream tasks comparable to current state-of-the-art
prompt-based methods. While LoRA is effective and easy to use, it remains
susceptible to overfitting in few-shot learning scenarios. To mitigate this
risk, we introduce a gradient-based regularization technique. This technique
effectively steers the optimization trajectory, encouraging the model to find a
more stable parameter region that is robust to variations in data distribution.
Through extensive experiments conducted on 15 benchmark datasets, we
demonstrate that GLAD outperforms previous tuning approaches in terms of
base-to-novel class generalization, image domain generalization, and
cross-dataset generalization. The code will be publicly available.

segmentation, stemming from ambiguous imaging boundaries and diverse clinical
expertise. Traditional deep learning methods producing single deterministic
segmentation predictions often fail to capture these annotator biases. Although
recent studies have explored multi-rater segmentation, existing methods
typically focus on a single perspective -- either generating a probabilistic
``gold standard'' consensus or preserving expert-specific preferences -- thus
struggling to provide a more omni view. In this study, we propose DiffOSeg, a
two-stage diffusion-based framework, which aims to simultaneously achieve both
consensus-driven (combining all experts' opinions) and preference-driven
(reflecting experts' individual assessments) segmentation. Stage I establishes
population consensus through a probabilistic consensus strategy, while Stage II
captures expert-specific preference via adaptive prompts. Demonstrated on two
public datasets (LIDC-IDRI and NPC-170), our model outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated metrics. Source code is available

                                        <span>  Open World Object Detection (OWOD) is a challenging computer vision task that
extends standard object detection by (1) detecting and classifying unknown
objects without supervision, and (2) incrementally learning new object classes
without forgetting previously learned ones. The absence of ground truths for
unknown objects makes OWOD tasks particularly challenging. Many methods have
addressed this by using pseudo-labels for unknown objects. The recently
proposed Probabilistic Objectness transformer-based open-world detector (PROB)
is a state-of-the-art model that does not require pseudo-labels for unknown
objects, as it predicts probabilistic objectness. However, this method faces
issues with learning conflicts between objectness and class predictions.
  To address this issue and further enhance performance, we propose a novel
model, Decoupled PROB. Decoupled PROB introduces Early Termination of
Objectness Prediction (ETOP) to stop objectness predictions at appropriate
layers in the decoder, resolving the learning conflicts between class and
objectness predictions in PROB. Additionally, we introduce Task-Decoupled Query
Initialization (TDQI), which efficiently extracts features of known and unknown
objects, thereby improving performance. TDQI is a query initialization method
that combines query selection and learnable queries, and it is a module that
can be easily integrated into existing DETR-based OWOD models. Extensive
experiments on OWOD benchmarks demonstrate that Decoupled PROB surpasses all
existing methods across several metrics, significantly improving performance.

important to detect all required objects accurately in real-time. Motion
segmentation offers a solution by identifying dynamic objects from the scene in
a class-agnostic manner. Recently, various motion segmentation models have been
proposed, most of which jointly use subnetworks to estimate Depth, Pose,
Optical Flow, and Scene Flow. As a result, the overall computational cost of
the model increases, hindering real-time performance.
  In this paper, we propose a novel cost-volume-based motion feature
representation, Channel-wise Motion Features. By extracting depth features of
each instance in the feature map and capturing the scene's 3D motion
information, it offers enhanced efficiency. The only subnetwork used to build
Channel-wise Motion Features is the Pose Network, and no others are required.
Our method not only achieves about 4 times the FPS of state-of-the-art models
in the KITTI Dataset and Cityscapes of the VCAS-Motion Dataset, but also
demonstrates equivalent accuracy while reducing the parameters to about 25$\%$.

Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful tool for automating
this process. Among the existing NAS approaches, Differentiable Architecture
Search (DARTS) has gained prominence for its efficiency and ease of use,
inspiring numerous advancements. Since the rise of Vision Transformers (ViT),
researchers have applied NAS to explore ViT architectures, often focusing on
macro-level search spaces and relying on discrete methods like evolutionary
algorithms. While these methods ensure reliability, they face challenges in
discovering innovative architectural designs, demand extensive computational
resources, and are time-intensive. To address these limitations, we introduce
Differentiable Architecture Search for Vision Transformer (DASViT), which
bridges the gap in differentiable search for ViTs and uncovers novel designs.
Experiments show that DASViT delivers architectures that break traditional
Transformer encoder designs, outperform ViT-B/16 on multiple datasets, and
achieve superior efficiency with fewer parameters and FLOPs.

that achieves performance comparable to the original dataset, thereby reducing
demands on storage and computational resources. Although diffusion models have
made significant progress in dataset distillation, the generated surrogate
datasets often contain samples with label inconsistencies or insufficient
structural detail, leading to suboptimal downstream performance. To address
these issues, we propose a detector-guided dataset distillation framework that
explicitly leverages a pre-trained detector to identify and refine anomalous
synthetic samples, thereby ensuring label consistency and improving image
quality. Specifically, a detector model trained on the original dataset is
employed to identify anomalous images exhibiting label mismatches or low
classification confidence. For each defective image, multiple candidates are
generated using a pre-trained diffusion model conditioned on the corresponding
image prototype and label. The optimal candidate is then selected by jointly
considering the detector's confidence score and dissimilarity to existing
qualified synthetic samples, thereby ensuring both label accuracy and
intra-class diversity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can
synthesize high-quality representative images with richer details, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on the validation set.

                                        <span>  Traffic Movement Count (TMC) at intersections is crucial for optimizing
signal timings, assessing the performance of existing traffic control measures,
and proposing efficient lane configurations to minimize delays, reduce
congestion, and promote safety. Traditionally, methods such as manual counting,
loop detectors, pneumatic road tubes, and camera-based recognition have been
used for TMC estimation. Although generally reliable, camera-based TMC
estimation is prone to inaccuracies under poor lighting conditions during harsh
weather and nighttime. In contrast, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)
technology is gaining popularity in recent times due to reduced costs and its
expanding use in 3D object detection, tracking, and related applications. This
paper presents the authors' endeavor to develop, deploy and evaluate a
dual-LiDAR system at an intersection in the city of Rialto, California, for TMC
estimation. The 3D bounding box detections from the two LiDARs are used to
classify vehicle counts based on traffic directions, vehicle movements, and
vehicle classes. This work discusses the estimated TMC results and provides
insights into the observed trends and irregularities. Potential improvements
are also discussed that could enhance not only TMC estimation, but also
trajectory forecasting and intent prediction at intersections.

                                        <span>  Scene understanding is one of the core tasks in computer vision, aiming to
extract semantic information from images to identify objects, scene categories,
and their interrelationships. Although advancements in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have driven progress in this field, existing VLMs still face challenges
in adaptation to unseen complex wide-area scenes. To address the challenges,
this paper proposes a Hierarchical Coresets Selection (HCS) mechanism to
advance the adaptation of VLMs in complex wide-area scene understanding. It
progressively refines the selected regions based on the proposed theoretically
guaranteed importance function, which considers utility, representativeness,
robustness, and synergy. Without requiring additional fine-tuning, HCS enables
VLMs to achieve rapid understandings of unseen scenes at any scale using
minimal interpretable regions while mitigating insufficient feature density.
HCS is a plug-and-play method that is compatible with any VLM. Experiments
demonstrate that HCS achieves superior performance and universality in various
tasks.

with Masked AutoRegressive (MAR) models gaining attention for their efficient
parallel decoding. However, MAR models have traditionally underperformed when
compared to standard AR models. This study refines the MAR architecture to
improve image generation quality. We begin by evaluating various image
tokenizers to identify the most effective one. Subsequently, we introduce an
improved Bidirectional LLaMA architecture by replacing causal attention with
bidirectional attention and incorporating 2D RoPE, which together form our
advanced model, MaskGIL. Scaled from 111M to 1.4B parameters, MaskGIL achieves
a FID score of 3.71, matching state-of-the-art AR models in the ImageNet
256x256 benchmark, while requiring only 8 inference steps compared to the 256
steps of AR models. Furthermore, we develop a text-driven MaskGIL model with
775M parameters for generating images from text at various resolutions. Beyond
image generation, MaskGIL extends to accelerate AR-based generation and enable
real-time speech-to-image conversion. Our codes and models are available at

their idealized assumptions about robot movement and control fail to reflect
physically embodied deployment challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce
VLN-PE, a physically realistic VLN platform supporting humanoid, quadruped, and
wheeled robots. For the first time, we systematically evaluate several
ego-centric VLN methods in physical robotic settings across different technical
pipelines, including classification models for single-step discrete action
prediction, a diffusion model for dense waypoint prediction, and a train-free,
map-based large language model (LLM) integrated with path planning. Our results
reveal significant performance degradation due to limited robot observation
space, environmental lighting variations, and physical challenges like
collisions and falls. This also exposes locomotion constraints for legged
robots in complex environments. VLN-PE is highly extensible, allowing seamless
integration of new scenes beyond MP3D, thereby enabling more comprehensive VLN
evaluation. Despite the weak generalization of current models in physical
deployment, VLN-PE provides a new pathway for improving cross-embodiment's
overall adaptability. We hope our findings and tools inspire the community to
rethink VLN limitations and advance robust, practical VLN models. The code is

achieved remarkable performance in recent years, but typically rely on
large-scale pixel-level annotated datasets. To address the challenge of
acquiring high-quality annotations, some recent weakly supervised methods
utilize image-level labels to segment manipulated regions. However, the
performance is still limited due to insufficient supervision signals. In this
study, we explore a form of weak supervision that improves the annotation
efficiency and detection performance, namely scribble annotation supervision.
We re-annotated mainstream IML datasets with scribble labels and propose the
first scribble-based IML (Sc-IML) dataset. Additionally, we propose the first
scribble-based weakly supervised IML framework. Specifically, we employ
self-supervised training with a structural consistency loss to encourage the
model to produce consistent predictions under multi-scale and augmented inputs.
In addition, we propose a prior-aware feature modulation module (PFMM) that
adaptively integrates prior information from both manipulated and authentic
regions for dynamic feature adjustment, further enhancing feature
discriminability and prediction consistency in complex scenes. We also propose
a gated adaptive fusion module (GAFM) that utilizes gating mechanisms to
regulate information flow during feature fusion, guiding the model toward
emphasizing potential tampered regions. Finally, we propose a confidence-aware
entropy minimization loss (${\mathcal{L}}_{ {CEM }}$). This loss dynamically
regularizes predictions in weakly annotated or unlabeled regions based on model
uncertainty, effectively suppressing unreliable predictions. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms existing fully supervised approaches
in terms of average performance both in-distribution and out-of-distribution.

                                        <span>  The remarkable success of contrastive-learning-based multimodal models has
been greatly driven by training on ever-larger datasets with expensive compute
consumption. Sample selection as an alternative efficient paradigm plays an
important direction to accelerate the training process. However, recent
advances on sample selection either mostly rely on an oracle model to offline
select a high-quality coreset, which is limited in the cold-start scenarios, or
focus on online selection based on real-time model predictions, which has not
sufficiently or efficiently considered the noisy correspondence. To address
this dilemma, we propose a novel Differential-Informed Sample Selection
(DISSect) method, which accurately and efficiently discriminates the noisy
correspondence for training acceleration. Specifically, we rethink the impact
of noisy correspondence on contrastive learning and propose that the
differential between the predicted correlation of the current model and that of
a historical model is more informative to characterize sample quality. Based on
this, we construct a robust differential-based sample selection and analyze its
theoretical insights. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and
various downstream tasks demonstrate the consistent superiority of DISSect over
current state-of-the-art methods. Source code is available at:

Transfomers motivate reusing the vast library of already trained
state-of-the-art networks. However, their latency, high computational costs and
memory demands pose significant challenges for deployment, especially on
resource-constrained hardware. While structured pruning methods can reduce
these factors, they often require costly retraining, sometimes for up to
hundreds of epochs, or even training from scratch to recover the lost accuracy
resulting from the structural modifications. Maintaining the provided
performance of trained models after structured pruning and thereby avoiding
extensive retraining remains a challenge. To solve this, we introduce
Variance-Based Pruning, a simple and structured one-shot pruning technique for
efficiently compressing networks, with minimal finetuning. Our approach first
gathers activation statistics, which are used to select neurons for pruning.
Simultaneously the mean activations are integrated back into the model to
preserve a high degree of performance. On ImageNet-1k recognition tasks, we
demonstrate that directly after pruning DeiT-Base retains over 70% of its
original performance and requires only 10 epochs of fine-tuning to regain 99%
of the original accuracy while simultaneously reducing MACs by 35% and model
size by 36%, thus speeding up the model by 1.44x.

                                        <span>  Accurate segmentation of orbital bones in facial computed tomography (CT)
images is essential for the creation of customized implants for reconstruction
of defected orbital bones, particularly challenging due to the ambiguous
boundaries and thin structures such as the orbital medial wall and orbital
floor. In these ambiguous regions, existing segmentation approaches often
output disconnected or under-segmented results. We propose a novel framework
that corrects segmentation results by leveraging consensus from multiple
diffusion model outputs. Our approach employs a conditional Bernoulli diffusion
model trained on diverse annotation patterns per image to generate multiple
plausible segmentations, followed by a consensus-driven correction that
incorporates position proximity, consensus level, and gradient direction
similarity to correct challenging regions. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method outperforms existing methods, significantly improving recall in
ambiguous regions while preserving the continuity of thin structures.
Furthermore, our method automates the manual process of segmentation result
correction and can be applied to image-guided surgical planning and surgery.

health monitoring using drive-by vibration response signals. Recognizing the
importance of spectral and temporal information, we introduce the
WaveletInception-BiLSTM network. The WaveletInception feature extractor
utilizes a Learnable Wavelet Packet Transform (LWPT) as the stem for extracting
vibration signal features, incorporating spectral information in the early
network layers. This is followed by 1D Inception networks that extract
multi-scale, high-level features at deeper layers. The extracted vibration
signal features are then integrated with operational conditions via a Long
Short-term Memory (LSTM) layer. The resulting feature extraction network
effectively analyzes drive-by vibration signals across various measurement
speeds without preprocessing and uses LSTM to capture interrelated temporal
dependencies among different modes of information and to create feature vectors
for health condition estimation. The estimator head is designed with a
sequential modeling architecture using bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) networks,
capturing bi-directional temporal relationships from drive-by measurements.
This architecture allows for a high-resolution, beam-level assessment of
infrastructure health conditions. A case study focusing on railway track
stiffness estimation with simulated drive-by vibration signals shows that the
model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in estimating railway
ballast and railpad stiffness parameters. Results underscore the potential of
this approach for accurate, localized, and fully automated drive-by
infrastructure health monitoring.

                                        <span>  Spectral reconstruction (SR) is a crucial problem in image processing that
requires reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSIs) from the corresponding RGB
images. A key difficulty in SR is estimating the unobservable feature, which
encapsulates significant spectral information not captured by RGB imaging
sensors. The solution lies in effectively constructing the spectral-spatial
joint distribution conditioned on the RGB image to complement the unobservable
feature. Since HSIs share a similar spatial structure with the corresponding
RGB images, it is rational to capitalize on the rich spatial knowledge in RGB
pre-trained models for spectral-spatial joint distribution learning. To this
end, we extend the RGB pre-trained latent diffusion model (RGB-LDM) to an
unobservable feature LDM (ULDM) for SR. As the RGB-LDM and its corresponding
spatial autoencoder (SpaAE) already excel in spatial knowledge, the ULDM can
focus on modeling spectral structure. Moreover, separating the unobservable
feature from the HSI reduces the redundant spectral information and empowers
the ULDM to learn the joint distribution in a compact latent space.
Specifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline consisting of spectral structure
representation learning and spectral-spatial joint distribution learning to
transform the RGB-LDM into the ULDM. In the first stage, a spectral
unobservable feature autoencoder (SpeUAE) is trained to extract and compress
the unobservable feature into a 3D manifold aligned with RGB space. In the
second stage, the spectral and spatial structures are sequentially encoded by
the SpeUAE and the SpaAE, respectively. The ULDM is then acquired to model the
distribution of the coded unobservable feature with guidance from the
corresponding RGB images. Experimental results on SR and downstream relighting
tasks demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

constitute the majority of fracture cases. However, diagnosing these conditions
is time-consuming and requires specialized expertise. Computer vision presents
a promising avenue, contingent upon the availability of extensive datasets, a
notable challenge in medical imaging. Therefore, reliance solely on one
modality, such as images, proves inadequate, especially in an era of diverse
and plentiful data types. In this study, we employ a multifaceted approach to
address the challenge of recognizing wrist pathologies using an extremely
limited dataset. Initially, we approach the problem as a fine-grained
recognition task, aiming to identify subtle X-ray pathologies that conventional
CNNs overlook. Secondly, we enhance network performance by fusing patient
metadata with X-ray images. Thirdly, rather than pre-training on a
coarse-grained dataset like ImageNet, we utilize weights trained on a
fine-grained dataset. While metadata integration has been used in other medical
domains, this is a novel application for wrist pathologies. Our results show
that a fine-grained strategy and metadata integration improve diagnostic
accuracy by 2% with a limited dataset and by over 10% with a larger
fracture-focused dataset.

                                        <span>  Producing expressive facial animations from static images is a challenging
task. Prior methods relying on explicit geometric priors (e.g., facial
landmarks or 3DMM) often suffer from artifacts in cross reenactment and
struggle to capture subtle emotions. Furthermore, existing approaches lack
support for multi-character animation, as driving features from different
individuals frequently interfere with one another, complicating the task. To
address these challenges, we propose FantasyPortrait, a diffusion transformer
based framework capable of generating high-fidelity and emotion-rich animations
for both single- and multi-character scenarios. Our method introduces an
expression-augmented learning strategy that utilizes implicit representations
to capture identity-agnostic facial dynamics, enhancing the model's ability to
render fine-grained emotions. For multi-character control, we design a masked
cross-attention mechanism that ensures independent yet coordinated expression
generation, effectively preventing feature interference. To advance research in
this area, we propose the Multi-Expr dataset and ExprBench, which are
specifically designed datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating
multi-character portrait animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FantasyPortrait significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both
quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, excelling particularly in
challenging cross reenactment and multi-character contexts. Our project page is

                                        <span>  Regularization is essential in deformable image registration (DIR) to ensure
that the estimated Deformation Vector Field (DVF) remains smooth, physically
plausible, and anatomically consistent. However, fine-tuning regularization
parameters in learning-based DIR frameworks is computationally expensive, often
requiring multiple training iterations. To address this, we propose cIDI, a
novel DIR framework based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that
conditions the registration process on regularization hyperparameters. Unlike
conventional methods that require retraining for each regularization
hyperparameter setting, cIDIR is trained over a prior distribution of these
hyperparameters, then optimized over the regularization hyperparameters by
using the segmentations masks as an observation. Additionally, cIDIR models a
continuous and differentiable DVF, enabling seamless integration of advanced
regularization techniques via automatic differentiation. Evaluated on the
DIR-LAB dataset, $\operatorname{cIDIR}$ achieves high accuracy and robustness
across the dataset.

core of our approach is FlexFormer, an expressive autoencoder that jointly
compresses video and text into unified latent representations. It supports
variable-length inputs with linearly adjustable compression rates, enabled by a
single query token design based on the Q-Former architecture. Additionally, by
encoding temporal context through position-aware mechanisms, our model
seamlessly supports prediction, retradiction, interpolation, and multi-shot

                                        <span>  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can process and integrate
information from multimodality sources, such as text and images. However,
interrelationship among input modalities, uncertainties due to individual
uni-modal data and potential clinical applications following such an
uncertainty decomposition are yet fully understood in the context of
large-scale MLLMs. In this work, we propose a multimodal uncertainty
propagation model (MUPM) based on uncertainty propagation, to characterise the
relationship among the uncertainties arising from image-only, text-only, and
joint image-text variations in MLLM inputs. Using real clinical data consisting
of cardiac MR scans and digital health records, we describe that MUPMs can be
optimised robustly with a few samples. We then show that the fitted MUPMs are
generalisable across different input data distributions and, perhaps
surprisingly, across different downstream tasks. Such a transferability may be
explained by the shared pretraining, comparatively light MLLM fine-tuning,
along with the low-dimensional nature of the MUPMs. More importantly, this
learned transferability, quantifying the relationship between these
uncertainties, led to direct clinical applications in which uncertainties may
be estimated and thus analysed robustly for varying data or even a novel set of
cardiac disease prediction tasks. In addition, we show experimentally the
efficiency in multimodal data required for estimating the overall uncertainty
and its ability to identify redundant factors, both of which are considered
practical yet clinically useful applications with the proposed MUPMs. Codes are
available at https://github.com/yucheng722/MUPM.

models on labeled cross-modal samples, this paper explores a weakly supervised
cross-modal person ReID method that uses only single-modal sample identity
labels, addressing scenarios where cross-modal identity labels are unavailable.
To mitigate the impact of missing cross-modal labels on model performance, we
propose a heterogeneous expert collaborative consistency learning framework,
designed to establish robust cross-modal identity correspondences in a weakly
supervised manner. This framework leverages labeled data from each modality to
independently train dedicated classification experts. To associate cross-modal
samples, these classification experts act as heterogeneous predictors,
predicting the identities of samples from the other modality. To improve
prediction accuracy, we design a cross-modal relationship fusion mechanism that
effectively integrates predictions from different experts. Under the implicit
supervision provided by cross-modal identity correspondences, collaborative and
consistent learning among the experts is encouraged, significantly enhancing
the model's ability to extract modality-invariant features and improve
cross-modal identity recognition. Experimental results on two challenging
datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

of coronary artery disease (CAD), yet it remains challenging due to the small
size, complex morphology, and low contrast with surrounding tissues. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel segmentation framework that leverages the
power of vision foundation models (VFMs) through a parallel encoding

module, while a convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder extracts local
details. These complementary features are adaptively fused using a cross-branch
variational fusion (CVF) module, which models latent distributions and applies
variational attention to assign modality-specific weights. Additionally, we
introduce an evidential-learning uncertainty refinement (EUR) module, which
quantifies uncertainty using evidence theory and refines uncertain regions by
incorporating multi-scale feature aggregation and attention mechanisms, further
enhancing segmentation accuracy. Extensive evaluations on one in-house and two
public datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in
accurate coronary artery segmentation and showcasing strong generalization
across multiple datasets. The code is available at

                                        <span>  Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation but
come with significant computational costs, posing challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Recent post-training quantization (PTQ)
methods have attempted to mitigate this issue by focusing on the iterative
nature of diffusion models. However, these approaches often overlook outliers,
leading to degraded performance at low bit-widths. In this paper, we propose a
DMQ which combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise
Power-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to effectively address these challenges. Learned
Equivalent Scaling optimizes channel-wise scaling factors to redistribute
quantization difficulty between weights and activations, reducing overall
quantization error. Recognizing that early denoising steps, despite having
small quantization errors, crucially impact the final output due to error
accumulation, we incorporate an adaptive timestep weighting scheme to
prioritize these critical steps during learning. Furthermore, identifying that
layers such as skip connections exhibit high inter-channel variance, we
introduce channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations. To ensure robust
selection of PTS factors even with small calibration set, we introduce a voting
algorithm that enhances reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing works, especially at low bit-widths
such as W4A6 (4-bit weight, 6-bit activation) and W4A8, maintaining high image
generation quality and model stability. The code is available at

                                        <span>  Advancements in foundation models have made it possible to conduct
applications in various downstream tasks. Especially, the new era has witnessed
a remarkable capability to extend Large Language Models (LLMs) for tackling
tasks of 3D scene understanding. Current methods rely heavily on 3D point
clouds, but the 3D point cloud reconstruction of an indoor scene often results
in information loss. Some textureless planes or repetitive patterns are prone
to omission and manifest as voids within the reconstructed 3D point clouds.
Besides, objects with complex structures tend to introduce distortion of
details caused by misalignments between the captured images and the dense
reconstructed point clouds. 2D multi-view images present visual consistency
with 3D point clouds and provide more detailed representations of scene
components, which can naturally compensate for these deficiencies. Based on
these insights, we propose Argus, a novel 3D multimodal framework that
leverages multi-view images for enhanced 3D scene understanding with LLMs. In
general, Argus can be treated as a 3D Large Multimodal Foundation Model
(3D-LMM) since it takes various modalities as input(text instructions, 2D
multi-view images, and 3D point clouds) and expands the capability of LLMs to
tackle 3D tasks. Argus involves fusing and integrating multi-view images and
camera poses into view-as-scene features, which interact with the 3D features
to create comprehensive and detailed 3D-aware scene embeddings. Our approach
compensates for the information loss while reconstructing 3D point clouds and
helps LLMs better understand the 3D world. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method outperforms existing 3D-LMMs in various downstream tasks.

motion capture systems for sports analysis. However, its practical application
is hindered by two factors: a lack of realistic sports datasets and unclear
reliability for sports tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce the
AthleticsPose dataset, a new public dataset featuring ``real'' motions captured
from 23 athletes performing various athletics events on an athletic field.
Using this dataset, we trained a representative 3D pose estimation model and
performed a comprehensive evaluation. Our results show that the model trained
on AthleticsPose significantly outperforms a baseline model trained on an
imitated sports motion dataset, reducing MPJPE by approximately 75 %. These
results show the importance of training on authentic sports motion data, as
models based on imitated motions do not effectively transfer to real-world
motions. Further analysis reveals that estimation accuracy is sensitive to
camera view and subject scale. In case studies of kinematic indicators, the
model demonstrated the potential to capture individual differences in knee
angles but struggled with higher-speed metrics, such as knee-drive velocity,
due to prediction biases. This work provides the research community with a
valuable dataset and clarifies the potential and practical limitations of using
monocular 3D pose estimation for sports motion analysis. Our dataset, code, and
checkpoints are available at https://github.com/SZucchini/AthleticsPose.

multiple clients to learn a global model without exposing their data to each
other. Consequently, it provides a secure learning platform with
privacy-preserving capabilities. This paper introduces a new dataset containing
23,326 images collected from eight different commercial sources and classified
into 31 categories, similar to the Office-31 dataset. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first image classification dataset specifically designed
for Federated Learning. We also propose two new Federated Learning algorithms,
namely Fed-Cyclic and Fed-Star. In Fed-Cyclic, a client receives weights from
its previous client, updates them through local training, and passes them to
the next client, thus forming a cyclic topology. In Fed-Star, a client receives
weights from all other clients, updates its local weights through
pre-aggregation (to address statistical heterogeneity) and local training, and
sends its updated local weights to all other clients, thus forming a star-like
topology. Our experiments reveal that both algorithms perform better than
existing baselines on our newly introduced dataset.

                                        <span>  Lane detection is a critical component of Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems
(ADAS) and Automated Driving System (ADS), providing essential spatial
information for lateral control. However, domain shifts often undermine model
reliability when deployed in new environments. Ensuring the robustness and
safety of lane detection models typically requires collecting and annotating
target domain data, which is resource-intensive. Estimating model performance
without ground-truth labels offers a promising alternative for efficient
robustness assessment, yet remains underexplored in lane detection. While
previous work has addressed performance estimation in image classification,
these methods are not directly applicable to lane detection tasks. This paper
first adapts five well-performing performance estimation methods from image
classification to lane detection, building a baseline. Addressing the
limitations of prior approaches that solely rely on softmax scores or lane
features, we further propose a new Lane Performance Estimation Framework
(LanePerf), which integrates image and lane features using a pretrained image
encoder and a DeepSets-based architecture, effectively handling zero-lane
detection scenarios and large domain-shift cases. Extensive experiments on the
OpenLane dataset, covering diverse domain shifts (scenes, weather, hours),
demonstrate that our LanePerf outperforms all baselines, achieving a lower MAE
of 0.117 and a higher Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.727. These
findings pave the way for robust, label-free performance estimation in ADAS,
supporting more efficient testing and improved safety in challenging driving
scenarios.

                                        <span>  Emotion recognition,as a step toward mind reading,seeks to infer internal
states from external cues.Most existing methods rely on explicit signals-such
as facial expressions,speech,or gestures-that reflect only bodily responses and
overlook the influence of environmental context.These cues are often
voluntary,easy to mask,and insufficient for capturing deeper,implicit emotions.
Physiological signal-based approaches offer more direct access to internal
states but require complex sensors that compromise natural behavior and limit
scalability.Gaze-based methods typically rely on static fixation analysis and
fail to capture the rich,dynamic interactions between gaze and the
environment,and thus cannot uncover the deep connection between emotion and
implicit behavior.To address these limitations,we propose a novel
camera-based,user-unaware emotion recognition approach that integrates gaze
fixation patterns with environmental semantics and temporal dynamics.Leveraging
standard HD cameras,our method unobtrusively captures users'eye appearance and
head movements in natural settings-without the need for specialized hardware or
active user participation.From these visual cues,the system estimates gaze
trajectories over time and space, providing the basis for modeling the spatial,
semantic,and temporal dimensions of gaze behavior. This allows us to capture
the dynamic interplay between visual attention and the surrounding
environment,revealing that emotions are not merely physiological responses but
complex outcomes of human-environment interactions.The proposed approach
enables user-unaware,real-time,and continuous emotion recognition,offering high
generalizability and low deployment cost.

leverages multi-channel bio-impedance sensing with soft, dry electrodes
embedded in a lightweight, necklace-style form factor. NeckSense captures
dynamic changes in tissue impedance around the neck, which are modulated by
head rotations and subtle muscle activations. To robustly estimate head pose,
we propose a deep learning framework that integrates anatomical priors,
including joint constraints and natural head rotation ranges, into the loss
function design. We validate NeckSense on 7 participants using the current SOTA
pose estimation model as ground truth. Our system achieves a mean per-vertex
error of 25.9 mm across various head movements with a leave-one-person-out

bio-impedance wearable can deliver head-tracking performance comparable to SOTA

by interpreting implicit user instructions, which may encompass subtleties such
as contextual cues and open-world knowledge. Despite significant advancements
made by existing approaches, they remain constrained by low perceptual
resolution, as visual encoders are typically pre-trained at lower resolutions.
Furthermore, simply interpolating the positional embeddings of visual encoders
to enhance perceptual resolution yields only marginal performance improvements
while incurring substantial computational costs. To address this, we propose
HRSeg, an efficient model with high-resolution fine-grained perception. It
features two key innovations: High-Resolution Perception (HRP) and
High-Resolution Enhancement (HRE). The HRP module processes high-resolution
images through cropping, integrating local and global features for
multi-granularity quality. The HRE module enhances mask features by integrating
fine-grained information from high-resolution images, refining their alignment
with text features for precise segmentation. Extensive ablation studies
validate the effectiveness of our modules, while comprehensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate HRSeg's superior performance.

for close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel
categories or generalize across datasets. This restricts their applicability in
diverse Earth observation scenarios. To address this, we introduce
open-vocabulary (OV) learning for remote sensing instance segmentation. While
current OV segmentation models perform well on natural image datasets, their
direct application to remote sensing faces challenges such as diverse
landscapes, seasonal variations, and the presence of small or ambiguous objects
in aerial imagery. To overcome these challenges, we propose $\textbf{SCORE}$
($\textbf{S}$cene $\textbf{C}$ontext matters in $\textbf{O}$pen-vocabulary
$\textbf{RE}$mote sensing instance segmentation), a framework that integrates
multi-granularity scene context, i.e., regional context and global context, to
enhance both visual and textual representations. Specifically, we introduce
Region-Aware Integration, which refines class embeddings with regional context
to improve object distinguishability. Additionally, we propose Global Context
Adaptation, which enriches naive text embeddings with remote sensing global
context, creating a more adaptable and expressive linguistic latent space for
the classifier. We establish new benchmarks for OV remote sensing instance
segmentation across diverse datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that,
our proposed method achieves SOTA performance, which provides a robust solution
for large-scale, real-world geospatial analysis. Our code is available at

apply it to unseen target domains with out-of-distribution data. Owing to
CLIP's strong ability to encode semantic concepts, it has attracted increasing
interest in domain generalization. However, CLIP often struggles to focus on
task-relevant regions across domains, i.e., domain-invariant regions, resulting
in suboptimal performance on unseen target domains. To address this challenge,
we propose an attention-refocusing scheme, called Simulate, Refocus and
Ensemble (SRE), which learns to reduce the domain shift by aligning the
attention maps in CLIP via attention refocusing. SRE first simulates domain
shifts by performing augmentation on the source data to generate simulated
target domains. SRE then learns to reduce the domain shifts by refocusing the
attention in CLIP between the source and simulated target domains. Finally, SRE
utilizes ensemble learning to enhance the ability to capture domain-invariant
attention maps between the source data and the simulated target data. Extensive
experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that SRE generally
achieves better results than state-of-the-art methods. The code is available

image captioning plays a significant role in interpreting vast and complex

Memory-Augmented Self-Attention, Mesh Transformer are evaluated and integrated.
We evaluate our proposed models using two benchmark remote sensing image

state-of-the-art systems on most of evaluation metrics, which demonstrates
potential to apply for real-life remote sensing image systems.

                                        <span>  Controllable captioning is essential for precise multimodal alignment and
instruction following, yet existing models often lack fine-grained control and
reliable evaluation protocols. To address this gap, we present the AnyCap
Project, an integrated solution spanning model, dataset, and evaluation. We
introduce AnyCapModel (ACM), a lightweight plug-and-play framework that
enhances the controllability of existing foundation models for omni-modal
captioning without retraining the base model. ACM reuses the original captions
from base models while incorporating user instructions and modality features to
generate improved captions. To remedy the data scarcity in controllable
multimodal captioning, we build AnyCapDataset (ACD), covering three modalities,
28 user-instruction types, and 300\,k high-quality data entries. We further
propose AnyCapEval, a new benchmark that provides more reliable evaluation
metrics for controllable captioning by decoupling content accuracy and
stylistic fidelity. ACM markedly improves caption quality across a diverse set
of base models on AnyCapEval. Notably, ACM-8B raises GPT-4o\'s content scores
by 45\% and style scores by 12\%, and it also achieves substantial gains on
widely used benchmarks such as MIA-Bench and VidCapBench.

occupy only a few dozen pixels, rendering detection and appearance-based
association unreliable. Building on the success of the MVA2023 SOD4SB
challenge, this paper introduces the SMOT4SB challenge, which leverages
temporal information to address limitations of single-frame detection. Our
three main contributions are: (1) the SMOT4SB dataset, consisting of 211 UAV
video sequences with 108,192 annotated frames under diverse real-world
conditions, designed to capture motion entanglement where both camera and
targets move freely in 3D; (2) SO-HOTA, a novel metric combining Dot Distance
with HOTA to mitigate the sensitivity of IoU-based metrics to small
displacements; and (3) a competitive MVA2025 challenge with 78 participants and
308 submissions, where the winning method achieved a 5.1x improvement over the
baseline. This work lays a foundation for advancing SMOT in UAV scenarios with
applications in bird strike avoidance, agriculture, fisheries, and ecological
monitoring.

important carrier of cultural heritage and emotional bonds. With the
development of technology, the need for accurate classification of food images
has grown, which is crucial for a variety of application scenarios. However,
existing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) face significant challenges when
dealing with fine-grained food images that are similar in shape but subtle in
detail. To address this challenge, this study presents an innovative method for
classifying food images, named Feature-Enhanced TResNet (FE-TResNet),
specifically designed to address fine-grained food images and accurately
capture subtle features within them. The FE-TResNet method is based on the
TResNet model and integrates Style-based Recalibration Module (StyleRM) and
Deep Channel-wise Attention (DCA) technologies to enhance feature extraction
capabilities. In experimental validation on Chinese food image datasets
ChineseFoodNet and CNFOOD-241, the FE-TResNet method significantly improved
classification accuracy, achieving rates of 81.37% and 80.29%, respectively,
demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority in fine-grained food image
classification.

                                        <span>  Composed image retrieval (CIR) is a vision language task that retrieves a
target image using a reference image and modification text, enabling intuitive
specification of desired changes. While effectively fusing visual and textual
modalities is crucial, existing methods typically adopt either early or late
fusion. Early fusion tends to excessively focus on explicitly mentioned textual
details and neglect visual context, whereas late fusion struggles to capture
fine-grained semantic alignments between image regions and textual tokens. To
address these issues, we propose FAR-Net, a multi-stage fusion framework
designed with enhanced semantic alignment and adaptive reconciliation,
integrating two complementary modules. The enhanced semantic alignment module
(ESAM) employs late fusion with cross-attention to capture fine-grained
semantic relationships, while the adaptive reconciliation module (ARM) applies
early fusion with uncertainty embeddings to enhance robustness and
adaptability. Experiments on CIRR and FashionIQ show consistent performance
gains, improving Recall@1 by up to 2.4% and Recall@50 by 1.04% over existing
state-of-the-art methods, empirically demonstrating that FAR Net provides a
robust and scalable solution to CIR tasks.

a gallery using a composed query consisting of a reference image and a
modification text. Among various CIR approaches, training-free zero-shot
methods based on pre-trained models are cost-effective but still face notable
limitations. For example, sequential VLM-LLM pipelines process each modality
independently, which often results in information loss and limits cross-modal
interaction. In contrast, methods based on multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) often focus exclusively on applying changes indicated by the text,
without fully utilizing the contextual visual information from the reference
image. To address these issues, we propose multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought with
re-ranking (MCoT-RE), a training-free zero-shot CIR framework. MCoT-RE utilizes
multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought to guide the MLLM to balance explicit
modifications and contextual visual cues, generating two distinct captions: one
focused on modification and the other integrating comprehensive visual-textual
context. The first caption is used to filter candidate images. Subsequently, we
combine these two captions and the reference image to perform multi-grained
re-ranking. This two-stage approach facilitates precise retrieval by aligning
with the textual modification instructions while preserving the visual context
of the reference image. Through extensive experiments, MCoT-RE achieves
state-of-the-art results among training-free methods, yielding improvements of
up to 6.24% in Recall@10 on FashionIQ and 8.58% in Recall@1 on CIRR.

                                        <span>  Video question answering (VQA) is a multimodal task that requires the
interpretation of a video to answer a given question. Existing VQA methods
primarily utilize question and answer (Q&A) pairs to learn the spatio-temporal
characteristics of video content. However, these annotations are typically
event-centric, which is not enough to capture the broader context of each
video. The absence of essential details such as object types, spatial layouts,
and descriptive attributes restricts the model to learning only a fragmented
scene representation. This issue limits the model's capacity for generalization
and higher-level reasoning. In this paper, we propose a fundamental question
generation with the integration of question embeddings for video question
answering (FIQ), a novel approach designed to strengthen the reasoning ability
of the model by enhancing the fundamental understanding of videos. FIQ
generates Q&A pairs based on descriptions extracted from videos, enriching the
training data with fundamental scene information. Generated Q&A pairs enable
the model to understand the primary context, leading to enhanced
generalizability and reasoning ability. Furthermore, we incorporate a VQ-CAlign
module that assists task-specific question embeddings with visual features,
ensuring that essential domain-specific details are preserved to increase the
adaptability of downstream tasks. Experiments on SUTD-TrafficQA demonstrate
that our FIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing
baseline methods.

                                        <span>  The variance in class-wise sample sizes within long-tailed scenarios often
results in degraded performance in less frequent classes. Fortunately,
foundation models, pre-trained on vast open-world datasets, demonstrate strong
potential for this task due to their generalizable representation, which
promotes the development of adaptive strategies on pre-trained models in
long-tailed learning. Advanced fine-tuning methods typically adjust visual
encoders while neglecting the semantics derived from the frozen text encoder,
overlooking the visual and textual alignment. To strengthen this alignment, we
propose a novel approach, Semantic-guided fine-tuning of foundation model for
long-tailed visual recognition (Sage), which incorporates semantic guidance
derived from textual modality into the visual fine-tuning process.
Specifically, we introduce an SG-Adapter that integrates class descriptions as
semantic guidance to guide the fine-tuning of the visual encoder. The
introduced guidance is passesed through the attention mechanism and enables the
model to focus more on semantically relevant content, strengthening the
alignment between the visual and textual modalities. Due to the inconsistent
class-conditional distributions neglected by the existing loss function, the
resulting prediction bias causes performance improvements for the tail class
less than for the head class, even when the multi-modal alignment is enhanced.
To address this challenge, we propose a novel distribution mismatch-aware
compensation factor, which is specifically designed to rectify the prediction
bias caused by the ignored inconsistent distribution based on our theoretical
analysis, and is seamlessly integrated into the loss function. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
Sage in enhancing performance in long-tailed learning.

                                        <span>  Audio-driven talking head generation requires precise synchronization between
facial animations and audio signals. This paper introduces ATL-Diff, a novel
approach addressing synchronization limitations while reducing noise and
computational costs. Our framework features three key components: a Landmark
Generation Module converting audio to facial landmarks, a Landmarks-Guide Noise
approach that decouples audio by distributing noise according to landmarks, and
a 3D Identity Diffusion network preserving identity characteristics.
Experiments on MEAD and CREMA-D datasets demonstrate that ATL-Diff outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across all metrics. Our approach achieves near
real-time processing with high-quality animations, computational efficiency,
and exceptional preservation of facial nuances. This advancement offers
promising applications for virtual assistants, education, medical
communication, and digital platforms. The source code is available at:

                                        <span>  Document quality assessment is critical for a wide range of applications
including document digitization, OCR, and archival. However, existing
approaches often struggle to provide accurate and robust quality scores,
limiting their applicability in practical scenarios. With the rapid progress in
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), recent MLLM-based methods have
achieved remarkable performance in image quality assessment. In this work, we
extend this success to the document domain by adapting DeQA-Score, a
state-of-the-art MLLM-based image quality scorer, for document quality
assessment. We propose DeQA-Doc, a framework that leverages the visual language
capabilities of MLLMs and a soft label strategy to regress continuous document
quality scores. To adapt DeQA-Score to DeQA-Doc, we adopt two complementary
solutions to construct soft labels without the variance information. Also, we
relax the resolution constrains to support the large resolution of document
images. Finally, we introduce ensemble methods to further enhance the
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeQA-Doc significantly
outperforms existing baselines, offering accurate and generalizable document
quality assessment across diverse degradation types. Codes and model weights

                                        <span>  Scene understanding enables intelligent agents to interpret and comprehend
their environment. While existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) for
scene understanding have primarily focused on indoor household tasks, they face
two significant limitations when applied to outdoor large-scale scene
understanding. First, outdoor scenarios typically encompass larger-scale
environments observed through various sensors from multiple viewpoints (e.g.,
bird view and terrestrial view), while existing indoor LVLMs mainly analyze
single visual modalities within building-scale contexts from humanoid
viewpoints. Second, existing LVLMs suffer from missing multidomain perception
outdoor data and struggle to effectively integrate 2D and 3D visual
information. To address the aforementioned limitations, we build the first
multidomain perception outdoor scene understanding dataset, named
\textbf{\underline{SVM-City}}, deriving from multi\textbf{\underline{S}}cale
scenarios with multi\textbf{\underline{V}}iew and
multi\textbf{\underline{M}}odal instruction tuning data. It contains $420$k
images and $4, 811$M point clouds with $567$k question-answering pairs from
vehicles, low-altitude drones, high-altitude aerial planes, and satellite. To
effectively fuse the multimodal data in the absence of one modality, we
introduce incomplete multimodal learning to model outdoor scene understanding
and design the LVLM named \textbf{\underline{City-VLM}}. Multimodal fusion is
realized by constructing a joint probabilistic distribution space rather than
implementing directly explicit fusion operations (e.g., concatenation).
Experimental results on three typical outdoor scene understanding tasks show
City-VLM achieves $18.14 \%$ performance surpassing existing LVLMs in
question-answering tasks averagely. Our method demonstrates pragmatic and
generalization performance across multiple outdoor scenes.

components in modern deep learning. Recent efforts have integrated transformer
blocks into compact neural architectures for computer vision, giving rise to
various efficient vision transformers. In this work, we introduce Transformer
with Kernel Complexity Reduction, or KCR-Transformer, a compact transformer
block equipped with differentiable channel selection, guided by a novel and
sharp theoretical generalization bound. KCR-Transformer performs input/output
channel selection in the MLP layers of transformer blocks to reduce the
computational cost. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis
establishing a tight generalization bound for networks equipped with
KCR-Transformer blocks. Leveraging such strong theoretical results, the channel
pruning by KCR-Transformer is conducted in a generalization-aware manner,
ensuring that the resulting network retains a provably small generalization
error. Our KCR-Transformer is compatible with many popular and compact
transformer networks, such as ViT and Swin, and it reduces the FLOPs of the
vision transformers while maintaining or even improving the prediction
accuracy. In the experiments, we replace all the transformer blocks in the
vision transformers with KCR-Transformer blocks, leading to KCR-Transformer
networks with different backbones. The resulting TCR-Transformers achieve
superior performance on various computer vision tasks, achieving even better
performance than the original models with even less FLOPs and parameters.

but its time-consuming generation process remains a challenge due to the
quadratic complexity of attention operations. Recent token merging methods
improve efficiency by reducing the number of tokens during attention
operations, but often overlook the characteristics of attention-based image
generation models, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose
local representative token guided merging (ReToM), a novel token merging
strategy applicable to any attention mechanism in image generation. To merge
tokens based on various contextual information, ReToM defines local boundaries
as windows within attention inputs and adjusts window sizes. Furthermore, we
introduce a representative token, which represents the most representative
token per window by computing similarity at a specific timestep and selecting
the token with the highest average similarity. This approach preserves the most
salient local features while minimizing computational overhead. Experimental
results show that ReToM achieves a 6.2% improvement in FID and higher CLIP
scores compared to the baseline, while maintaining comparable inference time.
We empirically demonstrate that ReToM is effective in balancing visual quality
and computational efficiency.

task-specific conditioning, enhancing scalability, efficiency, and
cost-effectiveness. To address the data collection challenges posed by this
paradigm -- such as low coverage density, behavioral redundancy, and safety
risks -- we introduce ATARA (Automated Task-Agnostic Random Actions), a
scalable self-supervised framework that accelerates collection by over $
30\times $ compared to human teleoperation. To further enable effective
learning from task-agnostic data, which often suffers from distribution
mismatch and irrelevant trajectories, we propose AnyPos, an inverse dynamics
model equipped with Arm-Decoupled Estimation and a Direction-Aware Decoder
(DAD). We additionally integrate a video-conditioned action validation module
to verify the feasibility of learned policies across diverse manipulation
tasks. Extensive experiments show that the AnyPos-ATARA pipeline yields a 51%
improvement in test accuracy and achieves 30-40% higher success rates in
downstream tasks such as lifting, pick-and-place, and clicking, using
replay-based video validation. Project Page:

real-time tracking of marine animals, specifically sharks, in dynamic marine
environments. The system integrates an onboard computer with a stabilised RGB-D
camera and a custom-trained OSTrack pipeline, enabling visual identification
under challenging lighting, occlusion, and sea-state conditions. A key
innovation is the inter-UAV handoff protocol, which enables seamless transfer
of tracking responsibilities between drones, extending operational coverage
beyond single-drone battery limitations. Performance is evaluated on a curated
shark dataset of 5,200 frames, achieving a tracking success rate of 81.9\%
during real-time flight control at 100 Hz, and robustness to occlusion,
illumination variation, and background clutter. We present a seamless UAV
handoff framework, where target transfer is attempted via high-confidence
feature matching, achieving 82.9\% target coverage. These results confirm the
viability of coordinated UAV operations for extended marine tracking and lay
the groundwork for scalable, autonomous monitoring.

                                        <span>  Reliable anticipation of traffic accidents is essential for advancing
autonomous driving systems. However, this objective is limited by two
fundamental challenges: the scarcity of diverse, high-quality training data and
the frequent absence of crucial object-level cues due to environmental
disruptions or sensor deficiencies. To tackle these issues, we propose a
comprehensive framework combining generative scene augmentation with adaptive
temporal reasoning. Specifically, we develop a video generation pipeline that
utilizes a world model guided by domain-informed prompts to create
high-resolution, statistically consistent driving scenarios, particularly
enriching the coverage of edge cases and complex interactions. In parallel, we
construct a dynamic prediction model that encodes spatio-temporal relationships
through strengthened graph convolutions and dilated temporal operators,
effectively addressing data incompleteness and transient visual noise.
Furthermore, we release a new benchmark dataset designed to better capture
diverse real-world driving risks. Extensive experiments on public and newly
released datasets confirm that our framework enhances both the accuracy and
lead time of accident anticipation, offering a robust solution to current data
and modeling limitations in safety-critical autonomous driving applications.

the intersection of computer vision and multimodal artificial intelligence,
with its core value lying in enhancing human-computer interaction through
immersive and empathetic engagement.With the advancement of multimodal large
language models, the driving signals for emotional talking-head generation has
shifted from audio and video to more flexible text. However, current
text-driven methods rely on predefined discrete emotion label texts,
oversimplifying the dynamic complexity of real facial muscle movements and thus
failing to achieve natural emotional expressiveness.This study proposes the
Think-Before-Draw framework to address two key challenges: (1) In-depth
semantic parsing of emotions--by innovatively introducing Chain-of-Thought
(CoT), abstract emotion labels are transformed into physiologically grounded
facial muscle movement descriptions, enabling the mapping from high-level
semantics to actionable motion features; and (2) Fine-grained expressiveness
optimization--inspired by artists' portrait painting process, a progressive
guidance denoising strategy is proposed, employing a "global emotion
localization--local muscle control" mechanism to refine micro-expression
dynamics in generated videos.Our experiments demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on widely-used benchmarks, including MEAD
and HDTF. Additionally, we collected a set of portrait images to evaluate our
model's zero-shot generation capability.

anatomical assessment but faces challenges due to multi-scale structural
heterogeneity. Conventional pixel-based approaches, lacking object-level
anatomical insight and inter-organ relational modeling, struggle with
morphological complexity and feature conflicts, limiting their efficacy in
UMIS. We propose Mamba Snake, a novel deep snake framework enhanced by state
space modeling for UMIS. Mamba Snake frames multi-contour evolution as a
hierarchical state space atlas, effectively modeling macroscopic inter-organ
topological relationships and microscopic contour refinements. We introduce a
snake-specific vision state space module, the Mamba Evolution Block (MEB),
which leverages effective spatiotemporal information aggregation for adaptive
refinement of complex morphologies. Energy map shape priors further ensure
robust long-range contour evolution in heterogeneous data. Additionally, a
dual-classification synergy mechanism is incorporated to concurrently optimize
detection and segmentation, mitigating under-segmentation of microstructures in
UMIS. Extensive evaluations across five clinical datasets reveal Mamba Snake's
superior performance, with an average Dice improvement of 3\% over
state-of-the-art methods.

                                        <span>  Modern deep models are trained on large real-world datasets, where data
quality varies and redundancy is common. Data-centric approaches such as
dataset pruning have shown promise in improving training efficiency and model
performance. However, most existing methods rely on static heuristics or
task-specific metrics, limiting their robustness and generalizability across
domains. In this work, we introduce a dynamic dataset pruning framework that
adaptively selects training samples based on both task-driven difficulty and
cross-modality semantic consistency. By incorporating supervision from
pretrained multimodal foundation models, our approach captures training
dynamics while effectively filtering out uninformative samples. Our work
highlights the potential of integrating cross-modality alignment for robust
sample selection, advancing data-centric learning toward more efficient and
robust practices across application domains.

                                        <span>  Spatial grounding, the process of associating natural language expressions
with corresponding image regions, has rapidly advanced due to the introduction
of transformer-based models, significantly enhancing multimodal representation
and cross-modal alignment. Despite this progress, the field lacks a
comprehensive synthesis of current methodologies, dataset usage, evaluation
metrics, and industrial applicability. This paper presents a systematic
literature review of transformer-based spatial grounding approaches from 2018
to 2025. Our analysis identifies dominant model architectures, prevalent

methodological trends and best practices. This study provides essential
insights and structured guidance for researchers and practitioners,
facilitating the development of robust, reliable, and industry-ready
transformer-based spatial grounding models.

generalizes many properties from linear algebra to third order tensors. Here,
we investigate positive semidefiniteness and semidefinite programming under the

choice of matrix M in the $\star_M$-product and the representation theory of an
underlying group action. Using this framework, third order tensors equipped
with the $\star_M$-product are a natural setting for the study of invariant
semidefinite programs. As applications of the M-SDP framework, we provide a
characterization of certain nonnegative quadratic forms and solve low-rank
tensor completion problems.

                                        <span>  Small object detection remains a challenging problem in the field of object
detection. To address this challenge, we propose an enhanced YOLOv8-based
model, SOD-YOLO. This model integrates an ASF mechanism in the neck to enhance
multi-scale feature fusion, adds a Small Object Detection Layer (named P2) to
provide higher-resolution feature maps for better small object detection, and
employs Soft-NMS to refine confidence scores and retain true positives.
Experimental results demonstrate that SOD-YOLO significantly improves detection
performance, achieving a 36.1% increase in mAP$_{50:95}$ and 20.6% increase in
mAP$_{50}$ on the VisDrone2019-DET dataset compared to the baseline model.
These enhancements make SOD-YOLO a practical and efficient solution for small
object detection in UAV imagery. Our source code, hyper-parameters, and model
weights are available at https://github.com/iamwangxiaobai/SOD-YOLO.

reconstruction that are essential for agriculture and computer graphics. While
neural parametric models are actively studied for humans and animals, plant
leaves present unique challenges due to their diverse shapes and flexible
deformation. To this problem, we introduce a neural parametric model for
leaves, NeuraLeaf. Capitalizing on the fact that flattened leaf shapes can be
approximated as a 2D plane, NeuraLeaf disentangles the leaves' geometry into
their 2D base shapes and 3D deformations. This representation allows learning
from rich sources of 2D leaf image datasets for the base shapes, and also has
the advantage of simultaneously learning textures aligned with the geometry. To
model the 3D deformation, we propose a novel skeleton-free skinning model and
create a newly captured 3D leaf dataset called DeformLeaf. We show that
NeuraLeaf successfully generates a wide range of leaf shapes with deformation,
resulting in accurate model fitting to 3D observations like depth maps and
point clouds. Our implementation and dataset are available at

complexity and high-resolution details required in clinical contexts.
Traditional generative architectures such as Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) or Variational Auto Encoder (VAEs) have shown great promise for
high-resolution image generation but struggle with preserving fine-grained
details that are key for accurate diagnosis. To address this issue, we
introduce Pixel Perfect MegaMed, the first vision-language foundation model to
synthesize images at resolutions of 1024x1024. Our method deploys a multi-scale
transformer architecture designed specifically for ultra-high resolution
medical image generation, enabling the preservation of both global anatomical
context and local image-level details. By leveraging vision-language alignment
techniques tailored to medical terminology and imaging modalities, Pixel
Perfect MegaMed bridges the gap between textual descriptions and visual
representations at unprecedented resolution levels. We apply our model to the
CheXpert dataset and demonstrate its ability to generate clinically faithful
chest X-rays from text prompts. Beyond visual quality, these high-resolution
synthetic images prove valuable for downstream tasks such as classification,
showing measurable performance gains when used for data augmentation,
particularly in low-data regimes. Our code is accessible through the project
website - https://tehraninasab.github.io/pixelperfect-megamed.

                                        <span>  Real robot data collection for imitation learning has led to significant
advancements in robotic manipulation. However, the requirement for robot
hardware in the process fundamentally constrains the scale of the data. In this
paper, we explore training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using egocentric
human videos. The benefit of using human videos is not only for their scale but
more importantly for the richness of scenes and tasks. With a VLA trained on
human video that predicts human wrist and hand actions, we can perform Inverse
Kinematics and retargeting to convert the human actions to robot actions. We
fine-tune the model using a few robot manipulation demonstrations to obtain the
robot policy, namely EgoVLA. We propose a simulation benchmark called Ego
Humanoid Manipulation Benchmark, where we design diverse bimanual manipulation
tasks with demonstrations. We fine-tune and evaluate EgoVLA with Ego Humanoid
Manipulation Benchmark and show significant improvements over baselines and
ablate the importance of human data. Videos can be found on our website:

                                        <span>  Modern neural networks (NNs) often do not generalize well in the presence of
a "covariate shift"; that is, in situations where the training and test data
distributions differ, but the conditional distribution of classification labels
remains unchanged. In such cases, NN generalization can be reduced to a problem
of learning more domain-invariant features. Domain adaptation (DA) methods
include a range of techniques aimed at achieving this; however, these methods
have struggled with the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning, which then
incurs significant computational costs. In this work, we introduce SIDDA, an
out-of-the-box DA training algorithm built upon the Sinkhorn divergence, that
can achieve effective domain alignment with minimal hyperparameter tuning and
computational overhead. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on multiple
simulated and real datasets of varying complexity, including simple shapes,
handwritten digits, and real astronomical observations. SIDDA is compatible
with a variety of NN architectures, and it works particularly well in improving
classification accuracy and model calibration when paired with equivariant
neural networks (ENNs). We find that SIDDA enhances the generalization
capabilities of NNs, achieving up to a $\approx40\%$ improvement in
classification accuracy on unlabeled target data. We also study the efficacy of
DA on ENNs with respect to the varying group orders of the dihedral group
$D_N$, and find that the model performance improves as the degree of
equivariance increases. Finally, we find that SIDDA enhances model calibration
on both source and target data--achieving over an order of magnitude
improvement in the ECE and Brier score. SIDDA's versatility, combined with its
automated approach to domain alignment, has the potential to advance
multi-dataset studies by enabling the development of highly generalizable
models.

structure-property relationships, radiation damage severely limits its use on
beam-sensitive materials like proteins and 2D materials. To overcome this
challenge, we push beyond the electron dose limits of conventional electron
microscopy by adapting principles from multi-image super-resolution (MISR) that
have been widely used in remote sensing. Our method fuses multiple
low-resolution, sub-pixel-shifted views and enhances the reconstruction with a
convolutional neural network (CNN) that integrates features from synthetic,
multi-angle observations. We developed a dual-path, attention-guided network
for 4D-STEM that achieves atomic-scale super-resolution from ultra-low-dose
data. This provides robust atomic-scale visualization across amorphous,
semi-crystalline, and crystalline beam-sensitive specimens. Systematic
evaluations on representative materials demonstrate comparable spatial
resolution to conventional ptychography under ultra-low-dose conditions. Our
work expands the capabilities of 4D-STEM, offering a new and generalizable
method for the structural analysis of radiation-vulnerable materials.

                                        <span>  Crop type classification using optical satellite time series remains limited
in its ability to generalize across seasons, particularly when crop phenology
shifts due to inter-annual weather variability. This hampers real-world
applicability in scenarios where current-year labels are unavailable. In
addition, uncertainty quantification is often overlooked, which reduces the
reliability of such approaches for operational crop monitoring. Inspired by
ecophysiological principles of plant growth, we propose a simple,
model-agnostic Thermal-Time-based Temporal Sampling (T3S) method that replaces
calendar time with thermal time. By subsampling time series in this
biologically meaningful way, our method highlights key periods within the
growing season while reducing temporal redundancy and noise. We evaluate the
T3S on a multi-year Sentinel-2 dataset covering the entirety of Switzerland,
which allows us to assess all applied methods on unseen years. Compared to
state-of-the-art baselines, our approach yields substantial improvements in
classification accuracy and, critically, provides well-calibrated uncertainty
estimates. Moreover, the T3S method excels in low-data regimes and enables
significantly more accurate early-season classification. With just 10% of the
training labels, it outperforms the current baseline in both accuracy and
uncertainty calibration, and by the end of June, it achieves a performance
similar to the full-season baseline model.

for the most part, coming from their input conditioning. This paper
investigates the representation used to condition diffusion models from the
perspective that ideal representations should improve sample fidelity, be easy
to generate, and be compositional to allow out-of-training samples generation.
We introduce Discrete Latent Code (DLC), an image representation derived from
Simplicial Embeddings trained with a self-supervised learning objective. DLCs
are sequences of discrete tokens, as opposed to the standard continuous image
embeddings. They are easy to generate and their compositionality enables
sampling of novel images beyond the training distribution. Diffusion models
trained with DLCs have improved generation fidelity, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for unconditional image generation on ImageNet. Additionally,
we show that composing DLCs allows the image generator to produce
out-of-distribution samples that coherently combine the semantics of images in
diverse ways. Finally, we showcase how DLCs can enable text-to-image generation
by leveraging large-scale pretrained language models. We efficiently finetune a
text diffusion language model to generate DLCs that produce novel samples
outside of the image generator training distribution.

                                        <span>  For anomaly detection (AD), early approaches often train separate models for
individual classes, yielding high performance but posing challenges in
scalability and resource management. Recent efforts have shifted toward
training a single model capable of handling multiple classes. However, directly
extending early AD methods to multi-class settings often results in degraded
performance. In this paper, we investigate this performance degradation
observed in reconstruction-based methods, identifying the key issue:
inter-class confusion. This confusion emerges when a model trained in
multi-class scenarios incorrectly reconstructs samples from one class as those
of another, thereby exacerbating reconstruction errors. To this end, we propose
a simple yet effective modification, called class-aware contrastive learning
(CCL). By explicitly leveraging raw object category information (\eg carpet or
wood) as supervised signals, we introduce local CL to refine multiscale dense
features, and global CL to obtain more compact feature representations of
normal patterns, thereby effectively adapting the models to multi-class
settings. Experiments across five datasets validate the effectiveness of our
approach, demonstrating significant improvements and superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, ablation studies indicate that
pseudo-class labels can achieve comparable performance.

neonates, with portable X-ray imaging serving as the standard diagnostic
modality in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). However, lung magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) offers a non-invasive alternative that avoids sedation
and radiation while providing detailed insights into the underlying mechanisms
of BPD. Leveraging high-resolution 3D MRI data, advanced image processing and
semantic segmentation algorithms can be developed to assist clinicians in
identifying the etiology of BPD. In this dataset, we present MRI scans paired
with corresponding semantic segmentations of the lungs and trachea for 40
neonates, the majority of whom are diagnosed with BPD. The imaging data consist
of free-breathing 3D stack-of-stars radial gradient echo acquisitions, known as
the StarVIBE series. Additionally, we provide comprehensive clinical data and
baseline segmentation models, validated against clinical assessments, to
support further research and development in neonatal lung imaging.

systems, requiring transferable adversarial attacks to explore the
vulnerabilities of them. Recently, vision-language models (VLM) based attacks
have shown superior transferability by attacking generalized image and textual
features of VLM, but they lack comprehensive feature disruption due to the
overemphasis on discriminative semantics in integral representation. In this
paper, we introduce the Attribute-aware Prompt Attack (AP-Attack), a novel
method that leverages VLM's image-text alignment capability to explicitly
disrupt fine-grained semantic features of pedestrian images by destroying
attribute-specific textual embeddings. To obtain personalized textual
descriptions for individual attributes, textual inversion networks are designed
to map pedestrian images to pseudo tokens that represent semantic embeddings,
trained in the contrastive learning manner with images and a predefined prompt
template that explicitly describes the pedestrian attributes. Inverted benign
and adversarial fine-grained textual semantics facilitate attacker in
effectively conducting thorough disruptions, enhancing the transferability of
adversarial examples. Extensive experiments show that AP-Attack achieves
state-of-the-art transferability, significantly outperforming previous methods
by 22.9% on mean Drop Rate in cross-model&dataset attack scenarios.

show classical augmentations can cause artifacts harming identity retention,
while InstantID improves fidelity when balanced with real images to avoid

human-like visual understanding, remains highly challenging. Recently,
compositional visual reasoning approaches, which leverage the reasoning
abilities of large language models (LLMs) with integrated tools to solve
problems, have shown promise as more effective strategies than end-to-end VR
methods. However, these approaches face limitations, as frozen LLMs lack tool
awareness in VR, leading to performance bottlenecks. While leveraging LLMs for
reasoning is widely used in other domains, they are not directly applicable to
VR due to limited training data, imperfect tools that introduce errors and
reduce data collection efficiency in VR, and challenging in fine-tuning on
noisy workflows. To address these challenges, we propose DWIM: i)
Discrepancy-aware training Workflow generation, which assesses tool usage and
extracts more viable workflows for training; and ii) Instruct-Masking
fine-tuning, which guides the model to only clone effective actions, enabling
the generation of more practical solutions. Our experiments demonstrate that
DWIM achieves state-of-the-art performance across various VR tasks, exhibiting
strong generalization on multiple widely-used datasets.

                                        <span>  Enabling Visual Semantic Models to effectively handle multi-view description
matching has been a longstanding challenge. Existing methods typically learn a
set of embeddings to find the optimal match for each view's text and compute
similarity. However, the visual and text embeddings learned through these
approaches have limited information capacity and are prone to interference from
locally similar negative samples. To address this issue, we argue that the
information capacity of embeddings is crucial and propose Dense-to-Sparse
Feature Distilled Visual Semantic Embedding (D2S-VSE), which enhances the
information capacity of sparse text by leveraging dense text distillation.
Specifically, D2S-VSE is a two-stage framework. In the pre-training stage, we
align images with dense text to enhance the information capacity of visual
semantic embeddings. In the fine-tuning stage, we optimize two tasks
simultaneously, distilling dense text embeddings to sparse text embeddings
while aligning images and sparse texts, enhancing the information capacity of
sparse text embeddings. Our proposed D2S-VSE model is extensively evaluated on
the large-scale MS-COCO and Flickr30K datasets, demonstrating its superiority
over recent state-of-the-art methods.

internal migration in Finland between 1800 and 1920 using digitized church
moving records. These records, maintained by Evangelical-Lutheran parishes,
document the migration of individuals and families and offer a valuable source
for studying historical demographic patterns. The dataset includes over six
million entries extracted from approximately 200,000 images of handwritten
migration records.
  The data extraction process was automated using a deep learning pipeline that
included layout analysis, table detection, cell classification, and handwriting
recognition. The complete pipeline was applied to all images, resulting in a
structured dataset suitable for research.
  The dataset can be used to study internal migration, urbanization, and family
migration, and the spread of disease in preindustrial Finland. A case study
from the Elim\"aki parish shows how local migration histories can be
reconstructed. The work demonstrates how large volumes of handwritten archival
material can be transformed into structured data to support historical and
demographic research.

                                        <span>  Despite the outstanding performance in vision-language reasoning, Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) might generate hallucinated contents that do not
exist in the given image. Most existing LVLM hallucination benchmarks are
constrained to evaluate the object-related hallucinations. However, the
potential hallucination on the relations between two objects, i.e., relation
hallucination, still lacks investigation. To remedy that, we design a unified
framework to measure the object and relation hallucination in LVLMs
simultaneously. The core idea of our framework is to evaluate hallucinations
via (object, relation, object) triplets extracted from LVLMs' responses, making
it easily generalizable to different vision-language tasks. Based on our
framework, we further introduce Tri-HE, a novel Triplet-level Hallucination
Evaluation benchmark which can be used to study both object and relation
hallucination at the same time. With comprehensive evaluations on Tri-HE, we
observe that the relation hallucination issue is even more serious than object
hallucination among existing LVLMs, highlighting a previously neglected problem
towards reliable LVLMs. Moreover, based on our findings, we design a simple
training-free approach that effectively mitigates hallucinations for LVLMs. Our
dataset and code for the reproduction of our experiments are available publicly
at https://github.com/wujunjie1998/Tri-HE.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we unify more than 10 existing one-step diffusion distillation
approaches, such as Diff-Instruct, DMD, SIM, SiD, $f$-distill, etc, inside a
theory-driven framework which we name the \textbf{\emph{Uni-Instruct}}.
Uni-Instruct is motivated by our proposed diffusion expansion theory of the
$f$-divergence family. Then we introduce key theories that overcome the
intractability issue of the original expanded $f$-divergence, resulting in an
equivalent yet tractable loss that effectively trains one-step diffusion models
by minimizing the expanded $f$-divergence family. The novel unification
introduced by Uni-Instruct not only offers new theoretical contributions that
help understand existing approaches from a high-level perspective but also
leads to state-of-the-art one-step diffusion generation performances. On the
CIFAR10 generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves record-breaking Frechet
Inception Distance (FID) values of \textbf{\emph{1.46}} for unconditional
generation and \textbf{\emph{1.38}} for conditional generation. On the
ImageNet-$64\times 64$ generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves a new SoTA
one-step generation FID of \textbf{\emph{1.02}}, which outperforms its 79-step
teacher diffusion with a significant improvement margin of 1.33 (1.02 vs 2.35).
We also apply Uni-Instruct on broader tasks like text-to-3D generation. For
text-to-3D generation, Uni-Instruct gives decent results, which slightly
outperforms previous methods, such as SDS and VSD, in terms of both generation
quality and diversity. Both the solid theoretical and empirical contributions
of Uni-Instruct will potentially help future studies on one-step diffusion
distillation and knowledge transferring of diffusion models.

location asynchronously. In this paper, we study the application of current
image-based SLAM techniques to these novel sensors. To this end, the
information in adaptively selected event windows is processed to form
motion-compensated images. These images are then used to reconstruct the scene

of the event-only pipeline to assess its capabilities. We compare the results
of different configurations of the proposed algorithm against the ground truth
for sequences of two publicly available event datasets. We also compare the
results of the proposed event-inertial pipeline with the state-of-the-art and
show it can produce comparable or more accurate results provided the map

                                        <span>  White Matter Hyperintensities (WMH) are key neuroradiological markers of
small vessel disease present in brain MRI. Assessment of WMH is important in
research and clinics. However, WMH are challenging to segment due to their high
variability in shape, location, size, poorly defined borders, and similar
intensity profile to other pathologies (e.g stroke lesions) and artefacts (e.g
head motion). In this work, we assess the utility and semantic properties of
the most effective techniques for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in
segmentation for the WMH segmentation task across multiple test-time data
distributions. We find UQ techniques reduce 'silent failure' by identifying in
UQ maps small WMH clusters in the deep white matter that are unsegmented by the
model. A combination of Stochastic Segmentation Networks with Deep Ensembles
also yields the highest Dice and lowest Absolute Volume Difference % (AVD)
score and can highlight areas where there is ambiguity between WMH and stroke
lesions. We further demonstrate the downstream utility of UQ, proposing a novel
method for classification of the clinical Fazekas score using spatial features
extracted from voxelwise WMH probability and UQ maps. We show that
incorporating WMH uncertainty information improves Fazekas classification
performance and calibration. Our model with (UQ and spatial WMH
features)/(spatial WMH features)/(WMH volume only) achieves a balanced accuracy
score of 0.74/0.67/0.62, and root brier score of 0.65/0.72/0.74 in the Deep WMH
and balanced accuracy of 0.74/0.73/0.71 and root brier score of 0.64/0.66/0.68
in the Periventricular region. We further demonstrate that stochastic UQ
techniques with high sample diversity can improve the detection of poor quality
segmentations.

                                        <span>  We introduce SeaS, a unified industrial generative model for automatically
creating diverse anomalies, authentic normal products, and precise anomaly
masks. While extensive research exists, most efforts either focus on specific
tasks, i.e., anomalies or normal products only, or require separate models for
each anomaly type. Consequently, prior methods either offer limited generative
capability or depend on a vast array of anomaly-specific models. We demonstrate
that U-Net's differentiated learning ability captures the distinct visual
traits of slightly-varied normal products and diverse anomalies, enabling us to
construct a unified model for all tasks. Specifically, we first introduce an
Unbalanced Abnormal (UA) Text Prompt, comprising one normal token and multiple
anomaly tokens. More importantly, our Decoupled Anomaly Alignment (DA) loss
decouples anomaly attributes and binds them to distinct anomaly tokens of UA,
enabling SeaS to create unseen anomalies by recombining these attributes.
Furthermore, our Normal-image Alignment (NA) loss aligns the normal token to
normal patterns, making generated normal products globally consistent and
locally varied. Finally, SeaS produces accurate anomaly masks by fusing
discriminative U-Net features with high-resolution VAE features. SeaS sets a
new benchmark for industrial generation, significantly enhancing downstream
applications, with average improvements of $+8.66\%$ pixel-level AP for
synthesis-based AD approaches, $+1.10\%$ image-level AP for unsupervised AD
methods, and $+12.79\%$ IoU for supervised segmentation models. Code is

                                        <span>  Generating accurate and realistic virtual human movements in real-time is of
high importance for a variety of applications in computer graphics, interactive
virtual environments, robotics, and biomechanics. This paper introduces a novel
real-time inverse kinematics (IK) solver specifically designed for realistic
human-like movement generation. Leveraging the automatic differentiation and
just-in-time compilation of TensorFlow, the proposed solver efficiently handles
complex articulated human skeletons with high degrees of freedom. By treating
forward and inverse kinematics as differentiable operations, our method
effectively addresses common challenges such as error accumulation and
complicated joint limits in multi-constrained problems, which are critical for
realistic human motion modeling. We demonstrate the solver's effectiveness on
the SMPLX human skeleton model, evaluating its performance against widely used
iterative-based IK algorithms, like Cyclic Coordinate Descent (CCD), FABRIK,
and the nonlinear optimization algorithm IPOPT. Our experiments cover both
simple end-effector tasks and sophisticated, multi-constrained problems with
realistic joint limits. Results indicate that our IK solver achieves real-time
performance, exhibiting rapid convergence, minimal computational overhead per
iteration, and improved success rates compared to existing methods. The project

                                        <span>  Foundation multi-modal models are often designed by stitching of multiple
existing pretrained uni-modal models: for example, an image classifier with an
text model. This stitching process is performed by training a connector module
that aims to align the representation spaces of these uni-modal models towards
a multi-modal objective. However, given the complexity of training such
connectors on large scale web-based datasets coupled with the ever-increasing
number of available pretrained uni-modal models, the task of uni-modal models
selection and subsequent connector module training becomes computationally
demanding. To address this under-studied critical problem, we propose
Hypernetwork Model Alignment (Hyma), a novel all-in-one solution for optimal
uni-modal model selection and connector training by leveraging hypernetworks.
Specifically, our framework utilizes the parameter prediction capability of a
hypernetwork to obtain jointly trained connector modules for $N \times M$
combinations of uni-modal models. In our experiments, Hyma reduces the cost of
searching for the best performing uni-modal model pair by $10\times$, while
matching the ranking and trained connector performance obtained via grid search
across a suite of diverse multi-modal benchmarks.

                                        <span>  Recently, deep learning methods have gained remarkable achievements in the
field of image restoration for remote sensing (RS). However, most existing RS
image restoration methods focus mainly on conventional first-order degradation
models, which may not effectively capture the imaging mechanisms of remote
sensing images. Furthermore, many RS image restoration approaches that use deep
learning are often criticized for their lacks of architecture transparency and
model interpretability. To address these problems, we propose a novel
progressive restoration network for high-order degradation imaging (HDI-PRNet),
to progressively restore different image degradation. HDI-PRNet is developed
based on the theoretical framework of degradation imaging, also Markov
properties of the high-order degradation process and Maximum a posteriori (MAP)
estimation, offering the benefit of mathematical interpretability within the
unfolding network. The framework is composed of three main components: a module
for image denoising that relies on proximal mapping prior learning, a module
for image deblurring that integrates Neumann series expansion with dual-domain
degradation learning, and a module for super-resolution. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on both synthetic and
real remote sensing images.

essential for neuro-oncology diagnosis and treatment planning. Despite advances
in deep learning methods, automatic segmentation remains challenging due to
tumor morphological heterogeneity and complex three-dimensional spatial
relationships. Current techniques primarily rely on visual features extracted
from MRI sequences while underutilizing semantic knowledge embedded in medical
reports. This research presents a multi-level fusion architecture that
integrates pixel-level, feature-level, and semantic-level information,
facilitating comprehensive processing from low-level data to high-level
concepts. The semantic-level fusion pathway combines the semantic understanding
capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models with the
spatial feature extraction advantages of 3D U-Net through three mechanisms:
3D-2D semantic bridging, cross-modal semantic guidance, and semantic-based
attention mechanisms. Experimental validation on the BraTS 2020 dataset
demonstrates that the proposed model achieves an overall Dice coefficient of
0.8567, representing a 4.8% improvement compared to traditional 3D U-Net, with
a 7.3% Dice coefficient increase in the clinically important enhancing tumor

with the environment. Learning a scene representation for multiple modalities
enhances comprehension of the physical world. However, modality conflicts,
arising from inherent distinctions among different modalities, present two
critical challenges: property disparity and granularity disparity. To address
these challenges, we propose a general framework, MMOne, to represent multiple
modalities in one scene, which can be readily extended to additional
modalities. Specifically, a modality modeling module with a novel modality
indicator is proposed to capture the unique properties of each modality.
Additionally, we design a multimodal decomposition mechanism to separate
multi-modal Gaussians into single-modal Gaussians based on modality
differences. We address the essential distinctions among modalities by
disentangling multimodal information into shared and modality-specific
components, resulting in a more compact and efficient multimodal scene
representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently
enhances the representation capability for each modality and is scalable to
additional modalities. The code is available at

                                        <span>  Existing state-of-the-art AI-Generated image detection methods mostly
consider extracting low-level information from RGB images to help improve the
generalization of AI-Generated image detection, such as noise patterns.
However, these methods often consider only a single type of low-level
information, which may lead to suboptimal generalization. Through empirical
analysis, we have discovered a key insight: different low-level information
often exhibits generalization capabilities for different types of forgeries.
Furthermore, we found that simple fusion strategies are insufficient to
leverage the detection advantages of each low-level and high-level information
for various forgery types. Therefore, we propose the Adaptive Low-level Experts
Injection (ALEI) framework. Our approach introduces Lora Experts, enabling the
backbone network, which is trained with high-level semantic RGB images, to
accept and learn knowledge from different low-level information. We utilize a
cross-attention method to adaptively fuse these features at intermediate
layers. To prevent the backbone network from losing the modeling capabilities
of different low-level features during the later stages of modeling, we
developed a Low-level Information Adapter that interacts with the features
extracted by the backbone network. Finally, we propose Dynamic Feature
Selection, which dynamically selects the most suitable features for detecting
the current image to maximize generalization detection capability. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method, finetuned on only four categories of
mainstream ProGAN data, performs excellently and achieves state-of-the-art
results on multiple datasets containing unseen GAN and Diffusion methods.

approaches often combine responses from multi-cultural populations, obscuring
demographic differences and risking amplifying biases. We conducted a
large-scale urban visual perception survey of streetscapes worldwide using
street view imagery, examining how demographics -- including gender, age,
income, education, race and ethnicity, and, for the first time, personality
traits -- shape perceptions among 1,000 participants with balanced demographics
from five countries and 45 nationalities. This dataset, Street Perception
Evaluation Considering Socioeconomics (SPECS), reveals demographic- and
personality-based differences across six traditional indicators (safe, lively,
wealthy, beautiful, boring, depressing) and four new ones (live nearby, walk,
cycle, green). Location-based sentiments further shape these preferences.
Machine learning models trained on existing global datasets tend to
overestimate positive indicators and underestimate negative ones compared to
human responses, underscoring the need for local context. Our study aspires to
rectify the myopic treatment of street perception, which rarely considers
demographics or personality traits.

examples 10 years ago, we still do not know how to train high-accuracy
classifiers that are guaranteed to be robust to small perturbations of their
inputs. Previous works often argued that this might be because no classifier
exists that is robust and accurate at the same time. However, in computer
vision this assumption does not match reality where humans are usually accurate
and robust on most tasks of interest. We offer an alternative explanation and
show that in certain settings robust generalization is only possible with
unrealistically large amounts of data. Specifically, we find a setting where a
robust classifier exists, it is easy to learn an accurate classifier, yet it
requires an exponential amount of data to learn a robust classifier. Based on
this theoretical result, we evaluate the influence of the amount of training
data on datasets such as CIFAR-10. Our findings indicate that the amount of
training data is the main factor determining the robust performance.
Furthermore we show that there are low magnitude directions in the data which
are useful for non-robust generalization but are not available for robust
classifiers. We provide code at

information fusion, requiring effective alignment of visual and textual
modalities for person retrieval using natural language queries. Existing
methods struggle with cross-modal heterogeneity, where visual and textual
features reside in disparate semantic spaces, creating substantial inter-modal
gaps that limit fusion effectiveness. We propose SCMM (Sew Calibration and
Masked Modeling), a novel framework addressing these fusion challenges through
two complementary mechanisms. First, our sew calibration loss implements
adaptive margin constraints guided by caption quality, dynamically aligning
image-text features while accommodating varying information density across
modalities. Second, our masked caption modeling loss establishes fine-grained
cross-modal correspondences through masked prediction tasks and cross-modal
attention, enabling detailed visual-textual relationship learning. The
streamlined dual-encoder architecture maintains computational efficiency while
achieving superior fusion performance through synergistic alignment and
correspondence strategies. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
validate SCMM's effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art Rank1 accuracies of
73.81%, 64.25%, and 57.35% on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReID
respectively. These results demonstrate the importance of quality-aware
adaptive constraints and fine-grained correspondence modeling in advancing
multimodal information fusion for person search applications.

generation from a single image. Unlike existing methods that rely on
reconstruction or retrieval techniques or recent approaches that employ
multi-stage object-by-object generation, MIDI extends pre-trained image-to-3D
object generation models to multi-instance diffusion models, enabling the
simultaneous generation of multiple 3D instances with accurate spatial
relationships and high generalizability. At its core, MIDI incorporates a novel
multi-instance attention mechanism, that effectively captures inter-object
interactions and spatial coherence directly within the generation process,
without the need for complex multi-step processes. The method utilizes partial
object images and global scene context as inputs, directly modeling object
completion during 3D generation. During training, we effectively supervise the
interactions between 3D instances using a limited amount of scene-level data,
while incorporating single-object data for regularization, thereby maintaining
the pre-trained generalization ability. MIDI demonstrates state-of-the-art
performance in image-to-scene generation, validated through evaluations on
synthetic data, real-world scene data, and stylized scene images generated by
text-to-image diffusion models.

interactions into standardised annotation formats that are compatible with
open-source annotation software. Additionally, a simple projector-based
interface projects visual guidance onto the object to assist users during the
annotation process, ensuring greater accuracy and consistency. The proposed
concept bridges the gap between human expertise and automated data generation,
enabling non-IT experts to contribute to the ML training pipeline and
preventing the loss of valuable training samples. Preliminary evaluation
results confirm the feasibility of capturing detailed annotation trajectories
and demonstrate that integration with CVAT streamlines the workflow for
subsequent ML tasks. This paper details the system architecture, calibration
procedures and interface design, and discusses its potential contribution to
future ML data generation for automated optical inspection.

                                        <span>  Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease affecting 35% of
extremely low birth weight infants. Defined by oxygen dependence at 36 weeks
postmenstrual age, it causes lifelong respiratory complications. However,
preventive interventions carry severe risks, including neurodevelopmental
impairment, ventilator-induced lung injury, and systemic complications.
Therefore, early BPD prognosis and prediction of BPD outcome is crucial to
avoid unnecessary toxicity in low risk infants. Admission radiographs of
extremely preterm infants are routinely acquired within 24h of life and could
serve as a non-invasive prognostic tool. In this work, we developed and
investigated a deep learning approach using chest X-rays from 163 extremely
low-birth-weight infants ($\leq$32 weeks gestation, 401-999g) obtained within
24 hours of birth. We fine-tuned a ResNet-50 pretrained specifically on adult
chest radiographs, employing progressive layer freezing with discriminative
learning rates to prevent overfitting and evaluated a CutMix augmentation and
linear probing. For moderate/severe BPD outcome prediction, our best performing
model with progressive freezing, linear probing and CutMix achieved an AUROC of
0.78 $\pm$ 0.10, balanced accuracy of 0.69 $\pm$ 0.10, and an F1-score of 0.67
$\pm$ 0.11. In-domain pre-training significantly outperformed ImageNet
initialization (p = 0.031) which confirms domain-specific pretraining to be
important for BPD outcome prediction. Routine IRDS grades showed limited
prognostic value (AUROC 0.57 $\pm$ 0.11), confirming the need of learned
markers. Our approach demonstrates that domain-specific pretraining enables
accurate BPD prediction from routine day-1 radiographs. Through progressive
freezing and linear probing, the method remains computationally feasible for
site-level implementation and future federated learning deployments.

                                        <span>  To alleviate the reliance of deep neural networks on large-scale datasets,
dataset distillation aims to generate compact, high-quality synthetic datasets
that can achieve comparable performance to the original dataset. The
integration of generative models has significantly advanced this field.
However, existing approaches primarily focus on aligning the distilled dataset
with the original one, often overlooking task-specific information that can be
critical for optimal downstream performance. In this paper, focusing on the
downstream task of classification, we propose a task-specific sampling strategy
for generative dataset distillation that incorporates the concept of difficulty
to consider the requirements of the target task better. The final dataset is
sampled from a larger image pool with a sampling distribution obtained by
matching the difficulty distribution of the original dataset. A logarithmic
transformation is applied as a pre-processing step to correct for
distributional bias. The results of extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method and suggest its potential for enhancing performance
on other downstream tasks. The code is available at

(FM), yet to date their performance on cell phenotyping has not been
benchmarked in a unified manner. We therefore propose PhenoBench: A
comprehensive benchmark for cell phenotyping on Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)
stained histopathology images. We provide both PhenoCell, a new H&E dataset
featuring 14 granular cell types identified by using multiplexed imaging, and
ready-to-use fine-tuning and benchmarking code that allows the systematic
evaluation of multiple prominent pathology FMs in terms of dense cell phenotype
predictions in different generalization scenarios. We perform extensive
benchmarking of existing FMs, providing insights into their generalization
behavior under technical vs. medical domain shifts. Furthermore, while FMs
achieve macro F1 scores > 0.70 on previously established benchmarks such as
Lizard and PanNuke, on PhenoCell, we observe scores as low as 0.20. This
indicates a much more challenging task not captured by previous benchmarks,
establishing PhenoCell as a prime asset for future benchmarking of FMs and
supervised models alike. Code and data are available on GitHub.

imaging modalities is challenging due to the scarcity of annotated data, and
manual mask annotations can be costly and labor-intensive to acquire. This
paper investigates leveraging generative models to synthesize data, for
training segmentation models for underrepresented modalities, particularly on
annotation-scarce MRI. Concretely, our contributions are threefold: (i) we
introduce MRGen-DB, a large-scale radiology image-text dataset comprising
extensive samples with rich metadata, including modality labels, attributes,
regions, and organs information, with a subset featuring pixel-wise mask
annotations; (ii) we present MRGen, a diffusion-based data engine for
controllable medical image synthesis, conditioned on text prompts and
segmentation masks. MRGen can generate realistic images for diverse MRI
modalities lacking mask annotations, facilitating segmentation training in
low-source domains; (iii) extensive experiments across multiple modalities
demonstrate that MRGen significantly improves segmentation performance on
unannotated modalities by providing high-quality synthetic data. We believe
that our method bridges a critical gap in medical image analysis, extending
segmentation capabilities to scenarios that are challenging to acquire manual
annotations. The codes, models, and data will be publicly available at

significant challenge in the development of machine learning models for
ophthalmology, hinders progress in the field. Existing methods for synthesising
Colour Fundus Photographs (CFPs) largely rely on predefined disease labels,
which restricts their ability to generate images that reflect fine-grained
anatomical variations, subtle disease stages, and diverse pathological features
beyond coarse class categories. To overcome these challenges, we first
introduce an innovative pipeline that creates a large-scale, captioned retinal
dataset comprising 1.4 million entries, called RetinaLogos-1400k. Specifically,
RetinaLogos-1400k uses the visual language model(VLM) to describe retinal
conditions and key structures, such as optic disc configuration, vascular
distribution, nerve fibre layers, and pathological features. Building on this
dataset, we employ a novel three-step training framework, RetinaLogos, which
enables fine-grained semantic control over retinal images and accurately
captures different stages of disease progression, subtle anatomical variations,
and specific lesion types. Through extensive experiments, our method
demonstrates superior performance across multiple datasets, with 62.07% of
text-driven synthetic CFPs indistinguishable from real ones by
ophthalmologists. Moreover, the synthetic data improves accuracy by 5%-10% in
diabetic retinopathy grading and glaucoma detection. Codes are available at

                                        <span>  Recent advances in vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise in
integrating image generation with action prediction to improve generalization
and reasoning in robot manipulation. However, existing methods are limited to
challenging image-based forecasting, which suffers from redundant information
and lacks comprehensive and critical world knowledge, including dynamic,
spatial and semantic information. To address these limitations, we propose
DreamVLA, a novel VLA framework that integrates comprehensive world knowledge
forecasting to enable inverse dynamics modeling, thereby establishing a
perception-prediction-action loop for manipulation tasks. Specifically,
DreamVLA introduces a dynamic-region-guided world knowledge prediction,
integrated with the spatial and semantic cues, which provide compact yet
comprehensive representations for action planning. This design aligns with how
humans interact with the world by first forming abstract multimodal reasoning
chains before acting. To mitigate interference among the dynamic, spatial and
semantic information during training, we adopt a block-wise structured
attention mechanism that masks their mutual attention, preventing information
leakage and keeping each representation clean and disentangled. Moreover, to
model the conditional distribution over future actions, we employ a
diffusion-based transformer that disentangles action representations from
shared latent features. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulation
environments demonstrate that DreamVLA achieves 76.7% success rate on real
robot tasks and 4.44 average length on the CALVIN ABC-D benchmarks.

                                        <span>  Generative adversarial attacks train a perturbation generator on a white-box
surrogate model and subsequently apply the crafted perturbations to unseen
black-box victim models. In contrast to iterative attacks, these methods
deliver superior inference-time efficiency, scalability, and transferability;
however, up until now, existing studies have not fully exploited the
representational capacity of generative models to preserve and harness semantic
information. Specifically, the intermediate activations of the generator encode
rich semantic features--object boundaries and coarse shapes--that remain
under-exploited, thereby limiting the alignment of perturbations with
object-salient regions which are critical for adversarial transferability. To
remedy this, we introduce a semantic structure-aware attack framework based on
the Mean Teacher, which serves as a temporally smoothed feature reference. With
this smoothed reference, we further direct semantic consistency between the
early-layer activations in the student and those of the semantically rich
teacher by feature distillation. By anchoring perturbation synthesis to the
semantically salient early intermediate blocks within the generator based on
empirical findings, our method guides progressive adversarial perturbation on
regions that substantially enhance adversarial transferability. We conduct
extensive experiments over diverse models, domains and tasks to demonstrate
consistent improvements relative to state-of-the-art generative attacks,
comprehensively evaluated using conventional metrics and our newly proposed
Accidental Correction Rate (ACR).

                                        <span>  3D modeling is moving from virtual to physical. Existing 3D generation
primarily emphasizes geometries and textures while neglecting physical-grounded
modeling. Consequently, despite the rapid development of 3D generative models,
the synthesized 3D assets often overlook rich and important physical
properties, hampering their real-world application in physical domains like
simulation and embodied AI. As an initial attempt to address this challenge, we
propose \textbf{PhysX}, an end-to-end paradigm for physical-grounded 3D asset
generation. 1) To bridge the critical gap in physics-annotated 3D datasets, we
present PhysXNet - the first physics-grounded 3D dataset systematically
annotated across five foundational dimensions: absolute scale, material,
affordance, kinematics, and function description. In particular, we devise a
scalable human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline based on vision-language models,
which enables efficient creation of physics-first assets from raw 3D assets.2)
Furthermore, we propose \textbf{PhysXGen}, a feed-forward framework for
physics-grounded image-to-3D asset generation, injecting physical knowledge
into the pre-trained 3D structural space. Specifically, PhysXGen employs a
dual-branch architecture to explicitly model the latent correlations between 3D
structures and physical properties, thereby producing 3D assets with plausible
physical predictions while preserving the native geometry quality. Extensive
experiments validate the superior performance and promising generalization
capability of our framework. All the code, data, and models will be released to
facilitate future research in generative physical AI.

                                        <span>  Analyzing fetal body motion and shape is paramount in prenatal diagnostics
and monitoring. Existing methods for fetal MRI analysis mainly rely on
anatomical keypoints or volumetric body segmentations. Keypoints simplify body
structure to facilitate motion analysis, but may ignore important details of
full-body shape. Body segmentations capture complete shape information but
complicate temporal analysis due to large non-local fetal movements. To address
these limitations, we construct a 3D articulated statistical fetal body model
based on the Skinned Multi-Person Linear Model (SMPL). Our algorithm
iteratively estimates body pose in the image space and body shape in the
canonical pose space. This approach improves robustness to MRI motion artifacts
and intensity distortions, and reduces the impact of incomplete surface
observations due to challenging fetal poses. We train our model on
segmentations and keypoints derived from $19,816$ MRI volumes across $53$
subjects. Our model captures body shape and motion across time series and
provides intuitive visualization. Furthermore, it enables automated
anthropometric measurements traditionally difficult to obtain from
segmentations and keypoints. When tested on unseen fetal body shapes, our
method yields a surface alignment error of $3.2$ mm for $3$ mm MRI voxel size.
To our knowledge, this represents the first 3D articulated statistical fetal
body model, paving the way for enhanced fetal motion and shape analysis in
prenatal diagnostics. The code is available at

external tools to assist a single MLLM in answering long video questions.
Despite such tool-based support, a solitary MLLM still offers only a partial
understanding of long videos, resulting in limited performance. In order to
better address long video tasks, we introduce LVAgent, the first framework
enabling multi-round dynamic collaboration of MLLM agents in long video
understanding. Our method consists of four key steps: 1) Selection: We
pre-select appropriate agents from the model library to form optimal agent
teams based on different tasks. 2) Perception: We design an effective retrieval
scheme for long videos to improve the coverage of critical temporal segments
while maintaining computational efficiency. 3) Action: Agents answer long video
questions and exchange reasons. 4) Reflection: We evaluate each agent's
performance in each round of discussion and optimize the agent team for dynamic
collaboration. The agents iteratively refine their answers by multi-round
dynamical collaboration of MLLM agents. LVAgent is the first agent system
method that outperforms all closed-source models (like GPT-4o) and open-source
models (like InternVL-2.5 and Qwen2-VL) in the long video understanding tasks.
Our LVAgent achieves an accuracy of 80\% on four mainstream long video
understanding tasks. Notably, LVAgent improves accuracy by 13.3\% on
LongVideoBench. Code is available at https://github.com/64327069/LVAgent.

representation models the combined effects of defocus, diffraction, aberration,
and accounts for sensor features such as pixel color filters and pixel-specific
micro-lenses. To learn the real-world blur field of a given device, we
formulate a generalized non-blind deconvolution problem that directly optimizes
the MLP weights using a small set of focal stacks as the only input. We also
provide a first-of-its-kind dataset of 5D blur fields$-$for smartphone cameras,
camera bodies equipped with a variety of lenses, etc. Lastly, we show that
acquired 5D blur fields are expressive and accurate enough to reveal, for the
first time, differences in optical behavior of smartphone devices of the same
make and model. Code and data can be found at blur-fields.github.io.

                                        <span>  Text-to-image diffusion model is a popular paradigm that synthesizes
personalized images by providing a text prompt and a random Gaussian noise.
While people observe that some noises are ``golden noises'' that can achieve
better text-image alignment and higher human preference than others, we still
lack a machine learning framework to obtain those golden noises. To learn
golden noises for diffusion sampling, we mainly make three contributions in
this paper. First, we identify a new concept termed the \textit{noise prompt},
which aims at turning a random Gaussian noise into a golden noise by adding a
small desirable perturbation derived from the text prompt. Following the
concept, we first formulate the \textit{noise prompt learning} framework that
systematically learns ``prompted'' golden noise associated with a text prompt
for diffusion models. Second, we design a noise prompt data collection pipeline
and collect a large-scale \textit{noise prompt dataset}~(NPD) that contains
100k pairs of random noises and golden noises with the associated text prompts.
With the prepared NPD as the training dataset, we trained a small \textit{noise
prompt network}~(NPNet) that can directly learn to transform a random noise
into a golden noise. The learned golden noise perturbation can be considered as
a kind of prompt for noise, as it is rich in semantic information and tailored
to the given text prompt. Third, our extensive experiments demonstrate the
impressive effectiveness and generalization of NPNet on improving the quality
of synthesized images across various diffusion models, including SDXL,
DreamShaper-xl-v2-turbo, and Hunyuan-DiT. Moreover, NPNet is a small and
efficient controller that acts as a plug-and-play module with very limited
additional inference and computational costs, as it just provides a golden
noise instead of a random noise without accessing the original pipeline.

                                        <span>  Fine-Grained Image Retrieval~(FGIR) faces challenges in learning
discriminative visual representations to retrieve images with similar
fine-grained features. Current leading FGIR solutions typically follow two
regimes: enforce pairwise similarity constraints in the semantic embedding
space, or incorporate a localization sub-network to fine-tune the entire model.
However, such two regimes tend to overfit the training data while forgetting
the knowledge gained from large-scale pre-training, thus reducing their
generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a Dual-Vision Adaptation
(DVA) approach for FGIR, which guides the frozen pre-trained model to perform
FGIR through collaborative sample and feature adaptation. Specifically, we
design Object-Perceptual Adaptation, which modifies input samples to help the
pre-trained model perceive critical objects and elements within objects that
are helpful for category prediction. Meanwhile, we propose In-Context
Adaptation, which introduces a small set of parameters for feature adaptation
without modifying the pre-trained parameters. This makes the FGIR task using
these adjusted features closer to the task solved during the pre-training.
Additionally, to balance retrieval efficiency and performance, we propose
Discrimination Perception Transfer to transfer the discriminative knowledge in
the object-perceptual adaptation to the image encoder using the knowledge
distillation mechanism. Extensive experiments show that DVA has fewer learnable
parameters and performs well on three in-distribution and three
out-of-distribution fine-grained datasets.

                                        <span>  Trajectory prediction is a challenging task that aims to predict the future
trajectory of vehicles or pedestrians over a short time horizon based on their
historical positions. The main reason is that the trajectory is a kind of
complex data, including spatial and temporal information, which is crucial for
accurate prediction. Intuitively, the more information the model can capture,
the more precise the future trajectory can be predicted. However, previous
works based on deep learning methods processed spatial and temporal information
separately, leading to inadequate spatial information capture, which means they
failed to capture the complete spatial information. Therefore, it is of
significance to capture information more fully and effectively on vehicle
interactions. In this study, we introduced an integrated 3D graph that
incorporates both spatial and temporal edges. Based on this, we proposed the
integrated 3D graph, which considers the cross-time interaction information. In
specific, we design a Spatial-Temporal Fusion (STF) model including Multi-layer
perceptions (MLP) and Graph Attention (GAT) to capture the spatial and temporal
information historical trajectories simultaneously on the 3D graph. Our
experiment on the ApolloScape Trajectory Datasets shows that the proposed STF
outperforms several baseline methods, especially on the long-time-horizon
trajectory prediction.

                                        <span>  In real-world applications of image recognition tasks, such as human pose
estimation, cameras often capture objects, like human bodies, at low
resolutions. This scenario poses a challenge in extracting and leveraging
multi-scale features, which is often essential for precise inference. To
address this challenge, we propose a new attention mechanism, named cascaded
multi-scale attention (CMSA), tailored for use in CNN-ViT hybrid architectures,
to handle low-resolution inputs effectively. The design of CMSA enables the
extraction and seamless integration of features across various scales without
necessitating the downsampling of the input image or feature maps. This is
achieved through a novel combination of grouped multi-head self-attention
mechanisms with window-based local attention and cascaded fusion of multi-scale
features over different scales. This architecture allows for the effective
handling of features across different scales, enhancing the model's ability to
perform tasks such as human pose estimation, head pose estimation, and more
with low-resolution images. Our experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in these areas with fewer
parameters, showcasing its potential for broad application in real-world
scenarios where capturing high-resolution images is not feasible. Code is

                                        <span>  Machine learning has achieved remarkable advancements but at the cost of
significant computational resources. This has created an urgent need for a
novel and energy-efficient computational fabric and corresponding algorithms.
CMOS Oscillator Networks (OscNet) is a brain inspired and specially designed
hardware for low energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a Hopfield
Network based machine learning algorithm that can be implemented on OscNet. The
network is trained using forward propagation alone to learn sparsely connected
weights, yet achieves an 8% improvement in accuracy compared to conventional
deep learning models on MNIST dataset. OscNet v1.5 achieves competitive
accuracy on MNIST and is well-suited for implementation using CMOS-compatible
ring oscillator arrays with SHIL. In oscillator-based inference, we utilize
only 24% of the connections used in a fully connected Hopfield network, with
merely a 0.1% drop in accuracy. OscNet v1.5 relies solely on forward
propagation and employs sparse connections, making it an energy-efficient
machine learning pipeline designed for oscillator computing fabric. The
repository for OscNet family is: https://github.com/RussRobin/OscNet .

                                        <span>  Recent studies have revealed that selecting informative and relevant video
frames can significantly improve the performance of Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs). Current methods, such as reducing inter-frame redundancy,
employing separate models for image-text relevance assessment, or utilizing
temporal video grounding for event localization, substantially adopt
unsupervised learning paradigms, whereas they struggle to address the complex
scenarios in long video understanding. We propose Instructed Temporal Grounding
for Videos (VideoITG), featuring customized frame sampling aligned with user
instructions. The core of VideoITG is the VidThinker pipeline, an automated
annotation framework that explicitly mimics the human annotation process.
First, it generates detailed clip-level captions conditioned on the
instruction; then, it retrieves relevant video segments through
instruction-guided reasoning; finally, it performs fine-grained frame selection
to pinpoint the most informative visual evidence. Leveraging VidThinker, we
construct the VideoITG-40K dataset, containing 40K videos and 500K instructed
temporal grounding annotations. We then design a plug-and-play VideoITG model,
which takes advantage of visual language alignment and reasoning capabilities
of Video-LLMs, for effective frame selection in a discriminative manner.
Coupled with Video-LLMs, VideoITG achieves consistent performance improvements
across multiple multimodal video understanding benchmarks, showing its
superiority and great potentials for video understanding.

                                        <span>  Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved
performance by increasing the number of visual tokens, which are often
significantly longer than text tokens. However, we observe that most real-world
scenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the
performance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models
still perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4
resolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with
different resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression,
namely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides
whether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output
a special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing
Efficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or
thresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by
case. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding
capability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens
on simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge
strategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully
design a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and
reasonable image resize call ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority, efficiency, and effectiveness of our method. Our code is available

range of robotic domains. However, the performance of these policies is heavily
dependent on the number of training demonstrations, which requires expensive
data collection in the real world. In this work, we aim to reduce data
collection efforts when learning visuomotor robot policies by leveraging
existing or cost-effective data from a wide range of embodiments, such as
public robot datasets and the datasets of humans playing with objects (human
data from play). Our approach leverages two key insights. First, we use optic
flow as an embodiment-agnostic action representation to train a World Model
(WM) across multi-embodiment datasets, and finetune it on a small amount of
robot data from the target embodiment. Second, we develop a method, Latent
Policy Steering (LPS), to improve the output of a behavior-cloned policy by
searching in the latent space of the WM for better action sequences. In real
world experiments, we observe significant improvements in the performance of
policies trained with a small amount of data (over 50% relative improvement
with 30 demonstrations and over 20% relative improvement with 50
demonstrations) by combining the policy with a WM pretrained on two thousand
episodes sampled from the existing Open X-embodiment dataset across different
robots or a cost-effective human dataset from play.

are they to true human -- or superhuman -- expertise? Genuine experts can
tackle the hardest problems and push the boundaries of scientific
understanding. To illuminate the limits of frontier model capabilities, we turn
away from contrived competitive programming puzzles, and instead focus on
real-life research problems.
  We construct FormulaOne, a benchmark that lies at the intersection of graph
theory, logic, and algorithms, all well within the training distribution of
frontier models. Our problems are incredibly demanding, requiring an array of
reasoning steps. The dataset has three key properties. First, it is of
commercial interest and relates to practical large-scale optimisation problems,
such as those arising in routing, scheduling, and network design. Second, it is
generated from the highly expressive framework of Monadic Second-Order (MSO)
logic on graphs, paving the way toward automatic problem generation at scale;
ideal for building RL environments. Third, many of our problems are intimately
related to the frontier of theoretical computer science, and to central
conjectures therein, such as the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). As
such, any significant algorithmic progress on our dataset, beyond known
results, could carry profound theoretical implications.
  Remarkably, state-of-the-art models like OpenAI's o3 fail entirely on
FormulaOne, solving less than 1% of the questions, even when given 10 attempts
and explanatory fewshot examples -- highlighting how far they remain from
expert-level understanding in some domains. To support further research, we
additionally curate FormulaOne-Warmup, offering a set of simpler tasks, from
the same distribution. We release the full corpus along with a comprehensive
evaluation framework.

of language models in meaningful ways? Most results in the literature have
shown inconsistent or marginal differences, both behaviorally and
representationally. In this work, we start from the hypothesis that the domain
in which VL training could have a significant effect is lexical-conceptual
knowledge, in particular its taxonomic organization. Through comparing minimal
pairs of text-only LMs and their VL-trained counterparts, we first show that
the VL models often outperform their text-only counterparts on a text-only
question-answering task that requires taxonomic understanding of concepts
mentioned in the questions. Using an array of targeted behavioral and
representational analyses, we show that the LMs and VLMs do not differ
significantly in terms of their taxonomic knowledge itself, but they differ in
how they represent questions that contain concepts in a taxonomic relation vs.
a non-taxonomic relation. This implies that the taxonomic knowledge itself does
not change substantially through additional VL training, but VL training does
improve the deployment of this knowledge in the context of a specific task,
even when the presentation of the task is purely linguistic.

                                        <span>  The reasoning-based pose estimation (RPE) benchmark has emerged as a widely
adopted evaluation standard for pose-aware multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Despite its significance, we identified critical reproducibility and
benchmark-quality issues that hinder fair and consistent quantitative
evaluations. Most notably, the benchmark utilizes different image indices from
those of the original 3DPW dataset, forcing researchers into tedious and
error-prone manual matching processes to obtain accurate ground-truth (GT)
annotations for quantitative metrics (\eg, MPJPE, PA-MPJPE). Furthermore, our
analysis reveals several inherent benchmark-quality limitations, including
significant image redundancy, scenario imbalance, overly simplistic poses, and
ambiguous textual descriptions, collectively undermining reliable evaluations
across diverse scenarios. To alleviate manual effort and enhance
reproducibility, we carefully refined the GT annotations through meticulous
visual matching and publicly release these refined annotations as an
open-source resource, thereby promoting consistent quantitative evaluations and
facilitating future advancements in human pose-aware multimodal reasoning.

                                        <span>  The evaluation of large language models is a complex task, in which several
approaches have been proposed. The most common is the use of automated
benchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different
topics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most
concerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is
to have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a
large and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and
costly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators
and having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is
the use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can
freely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.
The results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important
aspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how
energy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of
interest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena
that incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the
evaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented,
showing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy
consumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models. This suggests
that for most user interactions, the extra cost and energy incurred by the more
complex and top-performing models do not provide an increase in the perceived
quality of the responses that justifies their use.

of LLMs in designing ablation studies for scientific research. AbGen consists
of 1,500 expert-annotated examples derived from 807 NLP papers. In this
benchmark, LLMs are tasked with generating detailed ablation study designs for
a specified module or process based on the given research context. Our
evaluation of leading LLMs, such as DeepSeek-R1-0528 and o4-mini, highlights a
significant performance gap between these models and human experts in terms of
the importance, faithfulness, and soundness of the ablation study designs.
Moreover, we demonstrate that current automated evaluation methods are not
reliable for our task, as they show a significant discrepancy when compared to
human assessment. To better investigate this, we develop AbGen-Eval, a
meta-evaluation benchmark designed to assess the reliability of commonly used
automated evaluation systems in measuring LLM performance on our task. We
investigate various LLM-as-Judge systems on AbGen-Eval, providing insights for
future research on developing more effective and reliable LLM-based evaluation
systems for complex scientific tasks.

taking natural language descriptions and generating code based on it. However,
LLMs often generate incorrect code that users need to fix and the literature
suggests users often struggle to detect these errors. In this work we seek to
offer formal guarantees of correctness to LLM generated code; such guarantees
could improve the experience of using AI Code Assistants and potentially enable
natural language programming for users with little or no programming knowledge.
To address this challenge we propose to incorporate a formal query language
that can represent a user's intent in a formally defined but natural
language-like manner that a user can confirm matches their intent. Then, using
such a query we propose to verify LLM generated code to ensure it matches the
user's intent. We implement these ideas in our system, Astrogator, for the
Ansible programming language which includes such a formal query language, a
calculus for representing the behavior of Ansible programs, and a symbolic
interpreter which is used for the verification. On a benchmark suite of 21
code-generation tasks, our verifier is able to verify correct code in 83% of
cases and identify incorrect code in 92%.

healthcare. However, many valuable applications for quadrupedal robots remain
overlooked. This research explores the effectiveness of three reinforcement
learning algorithms in training a simulated quadruped robot for autonomous
navigation and obstacle avoidance. The goal is to develop a robotic guide dog
simulation capable of path following and obstacle avoidance, with long-term
potential for real-world assistance to guide dogs and visually impaired
individuals. It also seeks to expand research into medical 'pets', including
robotic guide and alert dogs.
  A comparative analysis of thirteen related research papers shaped key
evaluation criteria, including collision detection, pathfinding algorithms,
sensor usage, robot type, and simulation platforms. The study focuses on sensor
inputs, collision frequency, reward signals, and learning progression to
determine which algorithm best supports robotic navigation in complex
environments.
  Custom-made environments were used to ensure fair evaluation of all three
algorithms under controlled conditions, allowing consistent data collection.
Results show that Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) outperformed Deep
Q-Network (DQN) and Q-learning across all metrics, particularly in average and
median steps to goal per episode.
  By analysing these results, this study contributes to robotic navigation, AI
and medical robotics, offering insights into the feasibility of AI-driven
quadruped mobility and its role in assistive robotics.

                                        <span>  Advances in natural language processing and large language models are driving
a major transformation in Human Capital Management, with a growing interest in
building smart systems based on language technologies for talent acquisition,
upskilling strategies, and workforce planning. However, the adoption and
progress of these technologies critically depend on the development of reliable
and fair models, properly evaluated on public data and open benchmarks, which
have so far been unavailable in this domain.
  To address this gap, we present TalentCLEF 2025, the first evaluation
campaign focused on skill and job title intelligence. The lab consists of two
tasks: Task A - Multilingual Job Title Matching, covering English, Spanish,
German, and Chinese; and Task B - Job Title-Based Skill Prediction, in English.
Both corpora were built from real job applications, carefully anonymized, and
manually annotated to reflect the complexity and diversity of real-world labor
market data, including linguistic variability and gender-marked expressions.
  The evaluations included monolingual and cross-lingual scenarios and covered
the evaluation of gender bias.
  TalentCLEF attracted 76 registered teams with more than 280 submissions. Most
systems relied on information retrieval techniques built with multilingual
encoder-based models fine-tuned with contrastive learning, and several of them
incorporated large language models for data augmentation or re-ranking. The
results show that the training strategies have a larger effect than the size of
the model alone. TalentCLEF provides the first public benchmark in this field
and encourages the development of robust, fair, and transferable language
technologies for the labor market.

                                        <span>  Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key component in training large
language reasoning models (LLMs). However, recent studies questions its
effectiveness in improving multi-step reasoning-particularly on hard problems.
To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective strategy via
Question Augmentation: introduce partial solutions during training to reduce
problem difficulty and provide more informative learning signals. Our method,
QuestA, when applied during RL training on math reasoning tasks, not only
improves pass@1 but also pass@k-particularly on problems where standard RL
struggles to make progress. This enables continual improvement over strong
open-source models such as DeepScaleR and OpenMath Nemotron, further enhancing
their reasoning capabilities. We achieve new state-of-the-art results on math
benchmarks using 1.5B-parameter models: 67.1% (+5.3%) on AIME24, 59.5% (+10.0%)
on AIME25, and 35.5% (+4.0%) on HMMT25. Further, we provide theoretical
explanations that QuestA improves sample efficiency, offering a practical and
generalizable pathway for expanding reasoning capability through RL.

                                        <span>  Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm is a standard tool for black-box
optimization problems. The current state-of-the-art BO approach for permutation
spaces relies on the Mallows kernel-an $\Omega(n^2)$ representation that
explicitly enumerates every pairwise comparison. Inspired by the close
relationship between the Mallows kernel and pairwise comparison, we propose a
novel framework for generating kernel functions on permutation space based on
sorting algorithms. Within this framework, the Mallows kernel can be viewed as
a special instance derived from bubble sort. Further, we introduce the
\textbf{Merge Kernel} constructed from merge sort, which replaces the quadratic
complexity with $\Theta(n\log n)$ to achieve the lowest possible complexity.
The resulting feature vector is significantly shorter, can be computed in
linearithmic time, yet still efficiently captures meaningful permutation
distances. To boost robustness and right-invariance without sacrificing
compactness, we further incorporate three lightweight, task-agnostic
descriptors: (1) a shift histogram, which aggregates absolute element
displacements and supplies a global misplacement signal; (2) a split-pair line,
which encodes selected long-range comparisons by aligning elements across the
two halves of the whole permutation; and (3) sliding-window motifs, which
summarize local order patterns that influence near-neighbor objectives. Our
empirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed kernel consistently
outperforms the state-of-the-art Mallows kernel across various permutation
optimization benchmarks. Results confirm that the Merge Kernel provides a more
compact yet more effective solution for Bayesian optimization in permutation
space.

Vision Transformers (ViT) involves freezing the majority of the backbone
parameters and solely learning low-rank adaptation weight matrices to
accommodate downstream tasks. These low-rank matrices are commonly derived
through the multiplication structure of down-projection and up-projection
matrices, exemplified by methods such as LoRA and Adapter. In this work, we
observe an approximate orthogonality among any two row or column vectors within
any weight matrix of the backbone parameters; however, this property is absent
in the vectors of the down/up-projection matrices. Approximate orthogonality
implies a reduction in the upper bound of the model's generalization error,
signifying that the model possesses enhanced generalization capability. If the
fine-tuned down/up-projection matrices were to exhibit this same property as
the pre-trained backbone matrices, could the generalization capability of
fine-tuned ViTs be further augmented? To address this question, we propose an
Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (AOFT) strategy for representing the
low-rank weight matrices. This strategy employs a single learnable vector to
generate a set of approximately orthogonal vectors, which form the
down/up-projection matrices, thereby aligning the properties of these matrices
with those of the backbone. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves competitive performance across a range of downstream image
classification tasks, confirming the efficacy of the enhanced generalization
capability embedded in the down/up-projection matrices.

particularly when faced with adversarial multimodal inputs. To improve the
safety of MLLMs during inference, we introduce a modular and adaptive
inference-time intervention technology, AutoSteer, without requiring any
fine-tuning of the underlying model. AutoSteer incorporates three core
components: (1) a novel Safety Awareness Score (SAS) that automatically
identifies the most safety-relevant distinctions among the model's internal
layers; (2) an adaptive safety prober trained to estimate the likelihood of
toxic outputs from intermediate representations; and (3) a lightweight Refusal
Head that selectively intervenes to modulate generation when safety risks are
detected. Experiments on LLaVA-OV and Chameleon across diverse safety-critical
benchmarks demonstrate that AutoSteer significantly reduces the Attack Success
Rate (ASR) for textual, visual, and cross-modal threats, while maintaining
general abilities. These findings position AutoSteer as a practical,
interpretable, and effective framework for safer deployment of multimodal AI

concepts, making them a key benchmark for evaluating reasoning capabilities.
While large language models (LLMs) are widely evaluated for reasoning in
English, their abilities in Indic languages remain understudied, limiting our
understanding of whether these models generalize across languages. To address
this gap, we introduce a new Hindi Analogy Test Set (HATS), comprising 405
multiple-choice questions sourced from Indian government exams. We benchmark
state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs using various prompting strategies and
introduce a grounded Chain of Thought approach that leverages cognitive
theories of analogical reasoning. This approach improves model performance on
Hindi analogy questions. Our experiments show that models perform best with
English prompts, irrespective of the prompting strategy. Our test set addresses
the lack of a critical resource to evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities in
Hindi.

                                        <span>  We present VITA, a Vision-To-Action flow matching policy that evolves latent
visual representations into latent actions for visuomotor control. Traditional
flow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions
(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like
cross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating
time and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent
images as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action
while eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative
modeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different
modalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data
lacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional
visual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a
structured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,
up-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we
supervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs
through flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss
through sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end
learning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging
bi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and
2 real-world tasks. Despite its simplicity, MLP-only VITA outperforms or
matches state-of-the-art generative policies while reducing inference latency
by 50-130% compared to conventional flow matching policies requiring different
conditioning mechanisms or complex architectures. To our knowledge, VITA is the
first MLP-only flow matching policy capable of solving complex bi-manual
manipulation tasks like those in ALOHA benchmarks.

                                        <span>  The pursuit of a generalizable stereo matching model, capable of performing
across varying resolutions and disparity ranges without dataset-specific
fine-tuning, has revealed a fundamental trade-off. Iterative local search
methods achieve high scores on constrained benchmarks, but their core mechanism
inherently limits the global consistency required for true generalization. On
the other hand, global matching architectures, while theoretically more robust,
have been historically rendered infeasible by prohibitive computational and
memory costs. We resolve this dilemma with $S^2M^2$: a global matching
architecture that achieves both state-of-the-art accuracy and high efficiency
without relying on cost volume filtering or deep refinement stacks. Our design
integrates a multi-resolution transformer for robust long-range correspondence,
trained with a novel loss function that concentrates probability on feasible
matches. This approach enables a more robust joint estimation of disparity,
occlusion, and confidence. $S^2M^2$ establishes a new state of the art on the
Middlebury v3 and ETH3D benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior methods
across most metrics while reconstructing high-quality details with competitive
efficiency.

enhanced visual AI's capabilities, the challenge of inadequate data diversity
and volume remains, particularly in construction domain. This study presents a
novel image synthesis methodology tailored for construction worker detection,
leveraging the generative-AI platform Midjourney. The approach entails
generating a collection of 12,000 synthetic images by formulating 3000
different prompts, with an emphasis on image realism and diversity. These
images, after manual labeling, serve as a dataset for DNN training. Evaluation
on a real construction image dataset yielded promising results, with the model
attaining average precisions (APs) of 0.937 and 0.642 at
intersection-over-union (IoU) thresholds of 0.5 and 0.5 to 0.95, respectively.
Notably, the model demonstrated near-perfect performance on the synthetic
dataset, achieving APs of 0.994 and 0.919 at the two mentioned thresholds.
These findings reveal both the potential and weakness of generative AI in
addressing DNN training data scarcity.

decision-making tasks that involve reasoning across abstract functions and
predicates, where exact matches are often rare or unnecessary. Developing
efficient reasoning and computational techniques for such a combined formalism
presents a significant challenge. In this paper, we adopt a more
straightforward approach aiming at integrating two well-established and
computationally well-behaved components: higher-order patterns on one side and
fuzzy equivalences expressed through similarity relations based on minimum
T-norm on the other. We propose a unification algorithm for higher-order
patterns modulo these similarity relations and prove its termination,
soundness, and completeness. This unification problem, like its crisp
counterpart, is unitary. The algorithm computes a most general unifier with the
highest degree of approximation when the given terms are unifiable.

                                        <span>  The advancement of powerful yet opaque large language models (LLMs)
necessitates a fundamental revision of the philosophical criteria used to
evaluate artificial moral agents (AMAs). Pre-LLM frameworks often relied on the
assumption of transparent architectures, which LLMs defy due to their
stochastic outputs and opaque internal states. This paper argues that
traditional ethical criteria are pragmatically obsolete for LLMs due to this
mismatch. Engaging with core themes in the philosophy of technology, this paper
proffers a revised set of ten functional criteria to evaluate LLM-based
artificial moral agents: moral concordance, context sensitivity, normative
integrity, metaethical awareness, system resilience, trustworthiness,
corrigibility, partial transparency, functional autonomy, and moral
imagination. These guideposts, applied to what we term "SMA-LLS" (Simulating
Moral Agency through Large Language Systems), aim to steer AMAs toward greater
alignment and beneficial societal integration in the coming years. We
illustrate these criteria using hypothetical scenarios involving an autonomous
public bus (APB) to demonstrate their practical applicability in morally
salient contexts.

                                        <span>  Conventional reinforcement learning (RL) ap proaches often struggle to learn
effective policies under sparse reward conditions, necessitating the manual
design of complex, task-specific reward functions. To address this limitation,
rein forcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a promising
strategy that complements hand-crafted rewards with human-derived evaluation
signals. However, most existing RLHF methods depend on explicit feedback
mechanisms such as button presses or preference labels, which disrupt the
natural interaction process and impose a substantial cognitive load on the
user. We propose a novel reinforcement learning from implicit human feedback
(RLIHF) framework that utilizes non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG)
signals, specifically error-related potentials (ErrPs), to provide continuous,
implicit feedback without requiring explicit user intervention. The proposed
method adopts a pre-trained decoder to transform raw EEG signals into
probabilistic reward components, en abling effective policy learning even in
the presence of sparse external rewards. We evaluate our approach in a
simulation environment built on the MuJoCo physics engine, using a Kinova Gen2
robotic arm to perform a complex pick-and-place task that requires avoiding
obstacles while manipulating target objects. The results show that agents
trained with decoded EEG feedback achieve performance comparable to those
trained with dense, manually designed rewards. These findings validate the
potential of using implicit neural feedback for scalable and human-aligned
reinforcement learning in interactive robotics.

                                        <span>  Audio plays a crucial role in applications like speaker verification,
voice-enabled smart devices, and audio conferencing. However, audio
manipulations, such as deepfakes, pose significant risks by enabling the spread
of misinformation. Our empirical analysis reveals that existing methods for
detecting deepfake audio are often vulnerable to anti-forensic (AF) attacks,
particularly those attacked using generative adversarial networks. In this
article, we propose a novel collaborative learning method called SHIELD to
defend against generative AF attacks. To expose AF signatures, we integrate an
auxiliary generative model, called the defense (DF) generative model, which
facilitates collaborative learning by combining input and output. Furthermore,
we design a triplet model to capture correlations for real and AF attacked
audios with real-generated and attacked-generated audios using auxiliary
generative models. The proposed SHIELD strengthens the defense against
generative AF attacks and achieves robust performance across various generative
models. The proposed AF significantly reduces the average detection accuracy
from 95.49% to 59.77% for ASVspoof2019, from 99.44% to 38.45% for In-the-Wild,
and from 98.41% to 51.18% for HalfTruth for three different generative models.
The proposed SHIELD mechanism is robust against AF attacks and achieves an
average accuracy of 98.13%, 98.58%, and 99.57% in match, and 98.78%, 98.62%,
and 98.85% in mismatch settings for the ASVspoof2019, In-the-Wild, and
HalfTruth datasets, respectively.

                                        <span>  Prompt injection attacks, where malicious input is designed to manipulate AI
systems into ignoring their original instructions and following unauthorized
commands instead, were first discovered by Preamble, Inc. in May 2022 and
responsibly disclosed to OpenAI. Over the last three years, these attacks have
continued to pose a critical security threat to LLM-integrated systems. The
emergence of agentic AI systems, where LLMs autonomously perform multistep
tasks through tools and coordination with other agents, has fundamentally
transformed the threat landscape. Modern prompt injection attacks can now
combine with traditional cybersecurity exploits to create hybrid threats that
systematically evade traditional security controls. This paper presents a
comprehensive analysis of Prompt Injection 2.0, examining how prompt injections
integrate with Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF),
and other web security vulnerabilities to bypass traditional security measures.
We build upon Preamble's foundational research and mitigation technologies,
evaluating them against contemporary threats, including AI worms, multi-agent
infections, and hybrid cyber-AI attacks. Our analysis incorporates recent
benchmarks that demonstrate how traditional web application firewalls, XSS
filters, and CSRF tokens fail against AI-enhanced attacks. We also present
architectural solutions that combine prompt isolation, runtime security, and
privilege separation with novel threat detection capabilities.

generation and generalization to challenging scenarios. In this work, we
develop a model using simple design choices, and without additional supervision
or sensors, such as maps, depth, or multiple cameras. We show that our model
yields state-of-the-art performance, despite having only 469M parameters and
being trained on 280h of video data. It particularly stands out in difficult
scenarios like turning maneuvers and urban traffic. We test whether discrete
token models possibly have advantages over continuous models based on flow
matching. To this end, we set up a hybrid tokenizer that is compatible with
both approaches and allows for a side-by-side comparison. Our study concludes
in favor of the continuous autoregressive model, which is less brittle on
individual design choices and more powerful than the model built on discrete
tokens. Code, models and qualitative results are publicly available at

fundamental yet challenging problem in the pursuit of more reliable,
controllable, and capable machine intelligence. The recent success of reasoning
models and conversational AI systems has underscored the critical role of
reinforcement learning (RL) in enhancing these systems, driving increased
research interest at the intersection of RL and LLM alignment. This paper
provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in LLM alignment through the
lens of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), emphasizing the distinctions
between RL techniques employed in LLM alignment and those in conventional RL
tasks. In particular, we highlight the necessity of constructing neural reward
models from human data and discuss the formal and practical implications of
this paradigm shift. We begin by introducing fundamental concepts in RL to
provide a foundation for readers unfamiliar with the field. We then examine
recent advances in this research agenda, discussing key challenges and
opportunities in conducting IRL for LLM alignment. Beyond methodological
considerations, we explore practical aspects, including datasets, benchmarks,
evaluation metrics, infrastructure, and computationally efficient training and
inference techniques. Finally, we draw insights from the literature on
sparse-reward RL to identify open questions and potential research directions.
By synthesizing findings from diverse studies, we aim to provide a structured
and critical overview of the field, highlight unresolved challenges, and
outline promising future directions for improving LLM alignment through RL and
IRL techniques.

emerging large language models (LLMs). These methods exhibited excellent
generalization capabilities in instruction understanding and task reasoning.
However, they were constrained by the fixed knowledge bases and reasoning
abilities of LLMs, preventing fully incorporating experiential knowledge and
thus resulting in a lack of efficient evolutionary capacity. To address this,
we drew inspiration from the evolution capabilities of natural agents, and
proposed a self-evolving VLN framework (SE-VLN) to endow VLN agents with the
ability to continuously evolve during testing. To the best of our knowledge, it
was the first time that an multimodal LLM-powered self-evolving VLN framework
was proposed. Specifically, SE-VLN comprised three core modules, i.e., a
hierarchical memory module to transfer successful and failure cases into
reusable knowledge, a retrieval-augmented thought-based reasoning module to
retrieve experience and enable multi-step decision-making, and a reflection
module to realize continual evolution. Comprehensive tests illustrated that the
SE-VLN achieved navigation success rates of 57% and 35.2% in unseen
environments, representing absolute performance improvements of 23.9% and 15.0%
over current state-of-the-art methods on R2R and REVERSE datasets,
respectively. Moreover, the SE-VLN showed performance improvement with
increasing experience repository, elucidating its great potential as a
self-evolving agent framework for VLN.

                                        <span>  Learning-based monocular visual odometry (VO) poses robustness,
generalization, and efficiency challenges in robotics. Recent advances in
visual foundation models, such as DINOv2, have improved robustness and
generalization in various vision tasks, yet their integration in VO remains
limited due to coarse feature granularity. In this paper, we present DINO-VO, a
feature-based VO system leveraging DINOv2 visual foundation model for its
sparse feature matching. To address the integration challenge, we propose a
salient keypoints detector tailored to DINOv2's coarse features. Furthermore,
we complement DINOv2's robust-semantic features with fine-grained geometric
features, resulting in more localizable representations. Finally, a
transformer-based matcher and differentiable pose estimation layer enable
precise camera motion estimation by learning good matches. Against prior
detector-descriptor networks like SuperPoint, DINO-VO demonstrates greater
robustness in challenging environments. Furthermore, we show superior accuracy
and generalization of the proposed feature descriptors against standalone
DINOv2 coarse features. DINO-VO outperforms prior frame-to-frame VO methods on
the TartanAir and KITTI datasets and is competitive on EuRoC dataset, while
running efficiently at 72 FPS with less than 1GB of memory usage on a single
GPU. Moreover, it performs competitively against Visual SLAM systems on outdoor
driving scenarios, showcasing its generalization capabilities.

                                        <span>  Modern language models address complex questions through chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning (Wei et al., 2023) and retrieval augmentation (Lewis et al.,
2021), yet struggle with error propagation and knowledge integration.
Tree-structured reasoning methods, particularly the Probabilistic
Tree-of-Thought (ProbTree)(Cao et al., 2023) framework, mitigate these issues
by decomposing questions into hierarchical structures and selecting answers
through confidence-weighted aggregation of parametric and retrieved knowledge
(Yao et al., 2023). However, ProbTree's static implementation introduces two
key limitations: (1) the reasoning tree is fixed during the initial
construction phase, preventing dynamic adaptation to intermediate results, and
(2) each node requires exhaustive evaluation of all possible solution
strategies, creating computational inefficiency. We present a dynamic
reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 2018) framework that transforms
tree-based reasoning into an adaptive process. Our approach incrementally
constructs the reasoning tree based on real-time confidence estimates, while
learning optimal policies for action selection (decomposition, retrieval, or
aggregation). This maintains ProbTree's probabilistic rigor while improving
both solution quality and computational efficiency through selective expansion
and focused resource allocation. The work establishes a new paradigm for
treestructured reasoning that balances the reliability of probabilistic
frameworks with the flexibility required for real-world question answering
systems.

advancements, learning-based 6-DOF grasping approaches are still not turnkey
and struggle to generalize across different embodiments and in-the-wild
settings. We build upon the recent success on modeling the object-centric grasp
generation process as an iterative diffusion process. Our proposed framework,
GraspGen, consists of a DiffusionTransformer architecture that enhances grasp
generation, paired with an efficient discriminator to score and filter sampled
grasps. We introduce a novel and performant on-generator training recipe for
the discriminator. To scale GraspGen to both objects and grippers, we release a
new simulated dataset consisting of over 53 million grasps. We demonstrate that
GraspGen outperforms prior methods in simulations with singulated objects
across different grippers, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
FetchBench grasping benchmark, and performs well on a real robot with noisy
visual observations.

agnostic, and guaranteed to converge. We propose MULTIDIMENSIONAL PROBLEM
AGNOSTIC EXPLAINABLE AI (MUPAX), a deterministic, model agnostic explainability
technique, with guaranteed convergency. MUPAX measure theoretic formulation
gives principled feature importance attribution through structured perturbation
analysis that discovers inherent input patterns and eliminates spurious
relationships. We evaluate MUPAX on an extensive range of data modalities and
tasks: audio classification (1D), image classification (2D), volumetric medical
image analysis (3D), and anatomical landmark detection, demonstrating dimension
agnostic effectiveness. The rigorous convergence guarantees extend to any loss
function and arbitrary dimensions, making MUPAX applicable to virtually any
problem context for AI. By contrast with other XAI methods that typically
decrease performance when masking, MUPAX not only preserves but actually
enhances model accuracy by capturing only the most important patterns of the
original data. Extensive benchmarking against the state of the XAI art
demonstrates MUPAX ability to generate precise, consistent and understandable
explanations, a crucial step towards explainable and trustworthy AI systems.

their idealized assumptions about robot movement and control fail to reflect
physically embodied deployment challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce
VLN-PE, a physically realistic VLN platform supporting humanoid, quadruped, and
wheeled robots. For the first time, we systematically evaluate several
ego-centric VLN methods in physical robotic settings across different technical
pipelines, including classification models for single-step discrete action
prediction, a diffusion model for dense waypoint prediction, and a train-free,
map-based large language model (LLM) integrated with path planning. Our results
reveal significant performance degradation due to limited robot observation
space, environmental lighting variations, and physical challenges like
collisions and falls. This also exposes locomotion constraints for legged
robots in complex environments. VLN-PE is highly extensible, allowing seamless
integration of new scenes beyond MP3D, thereby enabling more comprehensive VLN
evaluation. Despite the weak generalization of current models in physical
deployment, VLN-PE provides a new pathway for improving cross-embodiment's
overall adaptability. We hope our findings and tools inspire the community to
rethink VLN limitations and advance robust, practical VLN models. The code is

interest in developing contrastive explanation techniques for optimisation,
especially concerning the solution of specific decision-making processes
formalised as MILPs. Along these lines, we propose X-MILP, a domain-agnostic
approach for building contrastive explanations for MILPs based on constraint
reasoning techniques. First, we show how to encode the queries a user makes
about the solution of an MILP problem as additional constraints. Then, we
determine the reasons that constitute the answer to the user's query by
computing the Irreducible Infeasible Subsystem (IIS) of the newly obtained set
of constraints. Finally, we represent our explanation as a "graph of reasons"
constructed from the IIS, which helps the user understand the structure among
the reasons that answer their query. We test our method on instances of
well-known optimisation problems to evaluate the empirical hardness of
computing explanations.

                                        <span>  Knowledge graph representation learning approaches provide a mapping between
symbolic knowledge in the form of triples in a knowledge graph (KG) and their
feature vectors. Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models often represent
relations in a KG as geometric transformations. Most state-of-the-art (SOTA)
KGE models are derived from elementary geometric transformations (EGTs), such
as translation, scaling, rotation, and reflection, or their combinations. These
geometric transformations enable the models to effectively preserve specific
structural and relational patterns of the KG. However, the current use of EGTs
by KGEs remains insufficient without considering relation-specific
transformations. Although recent models attempted to address this problem by
ensembling SOTA baseline models in different ways, only a single or composite
version of geometric transformations are used by such baselines to represent
all the relations. In this paper, we propose a framework that evaluates how
well each relation fits with different geometric transformations. Based on this
ranking, the model can: (1) assign the best-matching transformation to each
relation, or (2) use majority voting to choose one transformation type to apply
across all relations. That is, the model learns a single relation-specific EGT
in low dimensional vector space through an attention mechanism. Furthermore, we
use the correlation between relations and EGTs, which are learned in a low
dimension, for relation embeddings in a high dimensional vector space. The
effectiveness of our models is demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations
on three benchmark KGs as well as a real-world financial KG, witnessing a
performance comparable to leading models

internal representations of Large Language Models, yet they often fail to
capture domain-specific features not prevalent in their training corpora. This
paper introduces a residual learning approach that addresses this feature
blindness without requiring complete retraining. We propose training a
secondary SAE specifically to model the reconstruction error of a pretrained
SAE on domain-specific texts, effectively capturing features missed by the
primary model. By summing the outputs of both models during inference, we
demonstrate significant improvements in both LLM cross-entropy and explained
variance metrics across multiple specialized domains. Our experiments show that
this method efficiently incorporates new domain knowledge into existing SAEs
while maintaining their performance on general tasks. This approach enables
researchers to selectively enhance SAE interpretability for specific domains of
interest, opening new possibilities for targeted mechanistic interpretability
of LLMs.

                                        <span>  Probabilistic Event Calculus (PEC) is a logical framework for reasoning about
actions and their effects in uncertain environments, which enables the
representation of probabilistic narratives and computation of temporal
projections. The PEC formalism offers significant advantages in
interpretability and expressiveness for narrative reasoning. However, it lacks
mechanisms for goal-directed reasoning. This paper bridges this gap by
developing a formal translation of PEC domains into Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs), introducing the concept of "action-taking situations" to preserve PEC's
flexible action semantics. The resulting PEC-MDP formalism enables the
extensive collection of algorithms and theoretical tools developed for MDPs to
be applied to PEC's interpretable narrative domains. We demonstrate how the
translation supports both temporal reasoning tasks and objective-driven
planning, with methods for mapping learned policies back into human-readable
PEC representations, maintaining interpretability while extending PEC's
capabilities.

y Respuestas sobre Tablas en Espa\~nol (Questions and Answers about Tables in
Spanish). Our solution obtains answers to the questions by implementing Python
code generation with LLMs that is used to filter and process the table. This
solution evolves from the MRT implementation for the Semeval 2025 related task.
The process consists of multiple steps: analyzing and understanding the content
of the table, selecting the useful columns, generating instructions in natural
language, translating these instructions to code, running it, and handling
potential errors or exceptions. These steps use open-source LLMs and
fine-grained optimized prompts for each step. With this approach, we achieved
an accuracy score of 85\% in the task.

multiple nodes to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing
their raw data. At the same time, Generative AI -- particularly Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) -- have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of domains, such as healthcare, security, and Image Generation. However,
training generative models typically requires large datasets and significant
computational resources, which are often unavailable in real-world settings.
Acquiring such resources can be costly and inefficient, especially when many
underutilized devices -- such as IoT devices and edge devices -- with varying
capabilities remain idle. Moreover, obtaining large datasets is challenging due
to privacy concerns and copyright restrictions, as most devices are unwilling
to share their data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach
for decentralized GAN training that enables the utilization of distributed data
and underutilized, low-capability devices while not sharing data in its raw
form. Our approach is designed to tackle key challenges in decentralized
environments, combining KLD-weighted Clustered Federated Learning to address
the issues of data heterogeneity and multi-domain datasets, with Heterogeneous
U-Shaped split learning to tackle the challenge of device heterogeneity under
strict data sharing constraints -- ensuring that no labels or raw data, whether
real or synthetic, are ever shared between nodes. Experimental results shows
that our approach demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across
key performance metrics, where it achieves 1.1x -- 2.2x higher image generation
scores, an average 10% boost in classification metrics (up to 50% in
multi-domain non-IID settings), in much lower latency compared to several
benchmarks. Find our code at https://github.com/youssefga28/HuSCF-GAN.

                                        <span>  Wrist pathologies are frequently observed, particularly among children who
constitute the majority of fracture cases. However, diagnosing these conditions
is time-consuming and requires specialized expertise. Computer vision presents
a promising avenue, contingent upon the availability of extensive datasets, a
notable challenge in medical imaging. Therefore, reliance solely on one
modality, such as images, proves inadequate, especially in an era of diverse
and plentiful data types. In this study, we employ a multifaceted approach to
address the challenge of recognizing wrist pathologies using an extremely
limited dataset. Initially, we approach the problem as a fine-grained
recognition task, aiming to identify subtle X-ray pathologies that conventional
CNNs overlook. Secondly, we enhance network performance by fusing patient
metadata with X-ray images. Thirdly, rather than pre-training on a
coarse-grained dataset like ImageNet, we utilize weights trained on a
fine-grained dataset. While metadata integration has been used in other medical
domains, this is a novel application for wrist pathologies. Our results show
that a fine-grained strategy and metadata integration improve diagnostic
accuracy by 2% with a limited dataset and by over 10% with a larger
fracture-focused dataset.

indicate serious conditions like melanoma, a major contributor to skin cancer
mortality. The MedMNIST v2 dataset, inspired by MNIST, was recently introduced
to advance research in biomedical imaging and includes DermaMNIST, a dataset
for classifying pigmented lesions based on the HAM10000 dataset. This study
assesses ResNet-50 and EfficientNetV2L models for multi-class classification
using DermaMNIST, employing transfer learning and various layer configurations.
One configuration achieves results that match or surpass existing methods. This
study suggests that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can drive progress in
biomedical image analysis, significantly enhancing diagnostic accuracy.

                                        <span>  Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) plays a crucial role in speech-centric
multimedia applications, enabling machines to comprehend spoken language in
scenarios such as meetings, interviews, and customer service interactions. SLU
encompasses multiple tasks, including Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR),
spoken Named Entity Recognition (NER), and spoken Sentiment Analysis (SA).
However, existing methods often rely on separate model architectures for
individual tasks such as spoken NER and SA, which increases system complexity,
limits cross-task interaction, and fails to fully exploit heterogeneous
datasets available across tasks. To address these limitations, we propose
UniSLU, a unified framework that jointly models multiple SLU tasks within a
single architecture. Specifically, we propose a unified representation for
diverse SLU tasks, enabling full utilization of heterogeneous datasets across
multiple tasks. Built upon this representation, we propose a unified generative
method that jointly models ASR, spoken NER, and SA tasks, enhancing task
interactions and enabling seamless integration with large language models to
harness their powerful generative capabilities. Extensive experiments on public
SLU datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving superior
SLU performance compared to several benchmark methods, making it well-suited
for real-world speech-based multimedia scenarios. We will release all code and
models at github to facilitate future research.

for planning, optimization, and inference. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
algorithms form the computational backbone of this emerging branch of machine
learning. Unfortunately, the high computational cost limits their feasibility
for large-scale problems and real-world applications, and the existing MCMC
acceleration solutions are either limited in hardware flexibility or fail to
maintain efficiency at the system level across a variety of end-to-end
applications. This paper introduces \textbf{MC$^2$A}, an algorithm-hardware
co-design framework, enabling efficient and flexible optimization for MCMC
acceleration. Firstly, \textbf{MC$^2$A} analyzes the MCMC workload diversity
through an extension of the processor performance roofline model with a 3rd
dimension to derive the optimal balance between the compute, sampling and
memory parameters. Secondly, \textbf{MC$^2$A} proposes a parametrized hardware
accelerator architecture with flexible and efficient support of MCMC kernels
with a pipeline of ISA-programmable tree-structured processing units,
reconfigurable samplers and a crossbar interconnect to support irregular
access. Thirdly, the core of \textbf{MC$^2$A} is powered by a novel Gumbel
sampler that eliminates exponential and normalization operations. In the
end-to-end case study, \textbf{MC$^2$A} achieves an overall {$307.6\times$,
$1.4\times$, $2.0\times$, $84.2\times$} speedup compared to the CPU, GPU, TPU
and state-of-the-art MCMC accelerator. Evaluated on various representative MCMC
workloads, this work demonstrates and exploits the feasibility of general
hardware acceleration to popularize MCMC-based solutions in diverse application
domains.

                                        <span>  Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation but
come with significant computational costs, posing challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Recent post-training quantization (PTQ)
methods have attempted to mitigate this issue by focusing on the iterative
nature of diffusion models. However, these approaches often overlook outliers,
leading to degraded performance at low bit-widths. In this paper, we propose a
DMQ which combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise
Power-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to effectively address these challenges. Learned
Equivalent Scaling optimizes channel-wise scaling factors to redistribute
quantization difficulty between weights and activations, reducing overall
quantization error. Recognizing that early denoising steps, despite having
small quantization errors, crucially impact the final output due to error
accumulation, we incorporate an adaptive timestep weighting scheme to
prioritize these critical steps during learning. Furthermore, identifying that
layers such as skip connections exhibit high inter-channel variance, we
introduce channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations. To ensure robust
selection of PTS factors even with small calibration set, we introduce a voting
algorithm that enhances reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing works, especially at low bit-widths
such as W4A6 (4-bit weight, 6-bit activation) and W4A8, maintaining high image
generation quality and model stability. The code is available at

last layer. Motivated by human's hierarchical thinking capability, we propose
that a hierarchical decoder architecture could be built with different layers
decoding texts simultaneously. Due to limited time and computationally
resources, we choose to adapt a pretrained language model into this form of
hierarchical decoder. Language heads of the last layer are copied to different
selected intermediate layers, and fine-tuned with different task inputs. By
thorough experiments, we validate that these selective intermediate layers
could be adapted to speak meaningful and reasonable contents, and this paradigm
of hierarchical decoder can obtain state-of-the-art performances on multiple
tasks such as hierarchical text classification, classification-guided
generation, and hierarchical text generation. This study suggests the
possibility of a generalized hierarchical reasoner, pretraining from scratch.

                                        <span>  Advancements in foundation models have made it possible to conduct
applications in various downstream tasks. Especially, the new era has witnessed
a remarkable capability to extend Large Language Models (LLMs) for tackling
tasks of 3D scene understanding. Current methods rely heavily on 3D point
clouds, but the 3D point cloud reconstruction of an indoor scene often results
in information loss. Some textureless planes or repetitive patterns are prone
to omission and manifest as voids within the reconstructed 3D point clouds.
Besides, objects with complex structures tend to introduce distortion of
details caused by misalignments between the captured images and the dense
reconstructed point clouds. 2D multi-view images present visual consistency
with 3D point clouds and provide more detailed representations of scene
components, which can naturally compensate for these deficiencies. Based on
these insights, we propose Argus, a novel 3D multimodal framework that
leverages multi-view images for enhanced 3D scene understanding with LLMs. In
general, Argus can be treated as a 3D Large Multimodal Foundation Model
(3D-LMM) since it takes various modalities as input(text instructions, 2D
multi-view images, and 3D point clouds) and expands the capability of LLMs to
tackle 3D tasks. Argus involves fusing and integrating multi-view images and
camera poses into view-as-scene features, which interact with the 3D features
to create comprehensive and detailed 3D-aware scene embeddings. Our approach
compensates for the information loss while reconstructing 3D point clouds and
helps LLMs better understand the 3D world. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method outperforms existing 3D-LMMs in various downstream tasks.

                                        <span>  Transformers have revolutionized deep learning with applications in natural
language processing, computer vision, and beyond. However, their computational
demands make it challenging to deploy them on low-power edge devices. This
paper introduces an ultra-low-power, Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Array (CGRA)
architecture specifically designed to accelerate General Matrix Multiplication
(GEMM) operations in transformer models tailored for the energy and resource
constraints of edge applications. The proposed architecture integrates a 4 x 4
array of Processing Elements (PEs) for efficient parallel computation and
dedicated 4 x 2 Memory Operation Blocks (MOBs) for optimized LOAD/STORE
operations, reducing memory bandwidth demands and enhancing data reuse. A
switchless mesh torus interconnect network further minimizes power and latency
by enabling direct communication between PEs and MOBs, eliminating the need for
centralized switching. Through its heterogeneous array design and efficient
dataflow, this CGRA architecture addresses the unique computational needs of
transformers, offering a scalable pathway to deploy sophisticated machine
learning models on edge devices.

                                        <span>  Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to substantial
improvements in the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs), as measured by standard benchmarks. However, these gains often persist
even when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted
rewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true
reasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific
patterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective
and identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First,
\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test
problems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \emph{evaluation
fragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are
highly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning
consistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic
evaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting
fixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve
multiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across
structurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and
improving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular
benchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and
VAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for
RL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models,
with average declines of 48.0\% on AMC23 and 58.3\% on AIME24. These findings
suggest that many existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail
to generalize beyond specific numerical forms. Overall, VAR-MATH offers a
principled, contamination-resistant evaluation paradigm for mathematical
reasoning.

deceive, and influence human behaviour, with current models already
demonstrating human-level persuasion and strategic deception in specific
contexts. Humans are often the weakest link in cybersecurity systems, and a
misaligned AI system deployed internally within a frontier company may seek to
undermine human oversight by manipulating employees. Despite this growing
threat, manipulation attacks have received little attention, and no systematic
framework exists for assessing and mitigating these risks. To address this, we
provide a detailed explanation of why manipulation attacks are a significant
threat and could lead to catastrophic outcomes. Additionally, we present a
safety case framework for manipulation risk, structured around three core lines
of argument: inability, control, and trustworthiness. For each argument, we
specify evidence requirements, evaluation methodologies, and implementation
considerations for direct application by AI companies. This paper provides the
first systematic methodology for integrating manipulation risk into AI safety
governance, offering AI companies a concrete foundation to assess and mitigate
these threats before deployment.

                                        <span>  Recently, there has been a surge of interest in Multi-Target Cross-Domain
Recommendation (MTCDR), which aims to enhance recommendation performance across
multiple domains simultaneously. Existing MTCDR methods primarily rely on
domain-shared entities (\eg users or items) to fuse and transfer cross-domain
knowledge, which may be unavailable in non-overlapped recommendation scenarios.
Some studies model user preferences and item features as domain-sharable
semantic representations, which can be utilized to tackle the MTCDR task.
Nevertheless, they often require extensive auxiliary data for pre-training.
Developing more effective solutions for MTCDR remains an important area for
further exploration.
  Inspired by recent advancements in generative recommendation, this paper
introduces GMC, a generative paradigm-based approach for multi-target
cross-domain recommendation. The core idea of GMC is to leverage semantically
quantized discrete item identifiers as a medium for integrating multi-domain
knowledge within a unified generative model. GMC first employs an item
tokenizer to generate domain-shared semantic identifiers for each item, and
then formulates item recommendation as a next-token generation task by training
a domain-unified sequence-to-sequence model. To further leverage the domain
information to enhance performance, we incorporate a domain-aware contrastive
loss into the semantic identifier learning, and perform domain-specific
fine-tuning on the unified recommender. Extensive experiments on five public
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GMC compared to a range of baseline
methods.

                                        <span>  In the age of AI, human commanders need to use the computational powers
available in today's environment to simulate a very large number of scenarios.
Within each scenario, situations occur where different decision design options
could have ethical consequences. Making these decisions reliant on human
judgement is both counter-productive to the aim of exploring very large number
of scenarios in a timely manner and infeasible when considering the workload
needed to involve humans in each of these choices. In this paper, we move human
judgement outside the simulation decision cycle. Basically, the human will
design the ethical metric space, leaving it to the simulated environment to
explore the space. When the simulation completes its testing cycles, the
testing environment will come back to the human commander with a few options to
select from. The human commander will then exercise human-judgement to select
the most appropriate course of action, which will then get executed
accordingly. We assume that the problem of designing metrics that are
sufficiently granular to assess the ethical implications of decisions is
solved. Subsequently, the fundamental problem we look at in this paper is how
to weight ethical decisions during the running of these simulations; that is,
how to dynamically weight the ethical attributes when agents are faced with
decision options with ethical implications during generative simulations. The
multi-criteria decision making literature has started to look at nearby
problems, where the concept of entropy has been used to determine the weights
during aggregation. We draw from that literature different approaches to
automatically calculate the weights for ethical attributes during
simulation-based testing and evaluation.

paradigm for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models; as well as
for imitation learning of control policies. Here, we draw on a connection
between this successful strategy and the theory and practice of finding optimal
policies via Reinforcement Learning (RL). Building on existing literature, we
clarify that SFT can be understood as maximizing a lower bound on the RL
objective in a sparse reward setting. Giving support to its often observed good
performance. From this viewpoint, we realize that a small modification to SFT
leads to an importance weighted variant that behaves closer to training with RL
as it: i) optimizes a tighter bound to the RL objective and, ii) can improve
performance compared to SFT on curated data. We refer to this variant as
importance weighted supervised fine-tuning (iw-SFT). We show that it is easy to
implement and can be further generalized to training with quality scored data.
The resulting SFT variants are competitive with more advanced RL algorithms for
large language models and for training policies in continuous control tasks.

                                        <span>  As robots become increasingly capable of operating over extended periods --
spanning days, weeks, and even months -- they are expected to accumulate
knowledge of their environments and leverage this experience to assist humans
more effectively. This paper studies the problem of Long-term Active Embodied
Question Answering (LA-EQA), a new task in which a robot must both recall past
experiences and actively explore its environment to answer complex,
temporally-grounded questions. Unlike traditional EQA settings, which typically
focus either on understanding the present environment alone or on recalling a
single past observation, LA-EQA challenges an agent to reason over past,
present, and possible future states, deciding when to explore, when to consult
its memory, and when to stop gathering observations and provide a final answer.
Standard EQA approaches based on large models struggle in this setting due to
limited context windows, absence of persistent memory, and an inability to
combine memory recall with active exploration. To address this, we propose a
structured memory system for robots, inspired by the mind palace method from
cognitive science. Our method encodes episodic experiences as scene-graph-based
world instances, forming a reasoning and planning algorithm that enables
targeted memory retrieval and guided navigation. To balance the
exploration-recall trade-off, we introduce value-of-information-based stopping
criteria that determines when the agent has gathered sufficient information. We
evaluate our method on real-world experiments and introduce a new benchmark
that spans popular simulation environments and actual industrial sites. Our
approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding
substantial gains in both answer accuracy and exploration efficiency.

                                        <span>  Image captioning has emerged as a crucial task in the intersection of
computer vision and natural language processing, enabling automated generation
of descriptive text from visual content. In the context of remote sensing,
image captioning plays a significant role in interpreting vast and complex
satellite imagery, aiding applications such as environmental monitoring,
disaster assessment, and urban planning. This motivates us, in this paper, to
present a transformer based network architecture for remote sensing image
captioning (RSIC) in which multiple techniques of Static Expansion,
Memory-Augmented Self-Attention, Mesh Transformer are evaluated and integrated.
We evaluate our proposed models using two benchmark remote sensing image
datasets of UCM-Caption and NWPU-Caption. Our best model outperforms the
state-of-the-art systems on most of evaluation metrics, which demonstrates
potential to apply for real-life remote sensing image systems.

occupy only a few dozen pixels, rendering detection and appearance-based
association unreliable. Building on the success of the MVA2023 SOD4SB
challenge, this paper introduces the SMOT4SB challenge, which leverages
temporal information to address limitations of single-frame detection. Our
three main contributions are: (1) the SMOT4SB dataset, consisting of 211 UAV
video sequences with 108,192 annotated frames under diverse real-world
conditions, designed to capture motion entanglement where both camera and
targets move freely in 3D; (2) SO-HOTA, a novel metric combining Dot Distance
with HOTA to mitigate the sensitivity of IoU-based metrics to small
displacements; and (3) a competitive MVA2025 challenge with 78 participants and
308 submissions, where the winning method achieved a 5.1x improvement over the
baseline. This work lays a foundation for advancing SMOT in UAV scenarios with
applications in bird strike avoidance, agriculture, fisheries, and ecological
monitoring.

important carrier of cultural heritage and emotional bonds. With the
development of technology, the need for accurate classification of food images
has grown, which is crucial for a variety of application scenarios. However,
existing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) face significant challenges when
dealing with fine-grained food images that are similar in shape but subtle in
detail. To address this challenge, this study presents an innovative method for
classifying food images, named Feature-Enhanced TResNet (FE-TResNet),
specifically designed to address fine-grained food images and accurately
capture subtle features within them. The FE-TResNet method is based on the
TResNet model and integrates Style-based Recalibration Module (StyleRM) and
Deep Channel-wise Attention (DCA) technologies to enhance feature extraction
capabilities. In experimental validation on Chinese food image datasets
ChineseFoodNet and CNFOOD-241, the FE-TResNet method significantly improved
classification accuracy, achieving rates of 81.37% and 80.29%, respectively,
demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority in fine-grained food image
classification.

                                        <span>  Human intelligence exhibits a remarkable capacity for rapid adaptation and
effective problem-solving in novel and unfamiliar contexts. We argue that this
profound adaptability is fundamentally linked to the efficient construction and
refinement of internal representations of the environment, commonly referred to
as world models, and we refer to this adaptation mechanism as world model
induction. However, current understanding and evaluation of world models in
artificial intelligence (AI) remains narrow, often focusing on static
representations learned from training on a massive corpora of data, instead of
the efficiency and efficacy of models in learning these representations through
interaction and exploration within a novel environment. In this Perspective, we
provide a view of world model induction drawing on decades of research in
cognitive science on how humans learn and adapt so efficiently; we then call
for a new evaluation framework for assessing adaptive world models in AI.
Concretely, we propose a new benchmarking paradigm based on suites of carefully
designed games with genuine, deep and continually refreshing novelty in the
underlying game structures -- we refer to this kind of games as novel games. We
detail key desiderata for constructing these games and propose appropriate
metrics to explicitly challenge and evaluate the agent's ability for rapid
world model induction. We hope that this new evaluation framework will inspire
future evaluation efforts on world models in AI and provide a crucial step
towards developing AI systems capable of the human-like rapid adaptation and
robust generalization -- a critical component of artificial general
intelligence.

                                        <span>  Video question answering (VQA) is a multimodal task that requires the
interpretation of a video to answer a given question. Existing VQA methods
primarily utilize question and answer (Q&A) pairs to learn the spatio-temporal
characteristics of video content. However, these annotations are typically
event-centric, which is not enough to capture the broader context of each
video. The absence of essential details such as object types, spatial layouts,
and descriptive attributes restricts the model to learning only a fragmented
scene representation. This issue limits the model's capacity for generalization
and higher-level reasoning. In this paper, we propose a fundamental question
generation with the integration of question embeddings for video question
answering (FIQ), a novel approach designed to strengthen the reasoning ability
of the model by enhancing the fundamental understanding of videos. FIQ
generates Q&A pairs based on descriptions extracted from videos, enriching the
training data with fundamental scene information. Generated Q&A pairs enable
the model to understand the primary context, leading to enhanced
generalizability and reasoning ability. Furthermore, we incorporate a VQ-CAlign
module that assists task-specific question embeddings with visual features,
ensuring that essential domain-specific details are preserved to increase the
adaptability of downstream tasks. Experiments on SUTD-TrafficQA demonstrate
that our FIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing
baseline methods.

                                        <span>  Large language models (LLMs) excel at modeling relationships between strings
in natural language and have shown promise in extending to other symbolic
domains like coding or mathematics. However, the extent to which they
implicitly model symbolic music remains underexplored. This paper investigates
how LLMs represent musical concepts by generating symbolic music data from
textual prompts describing combinations of genres and styles, and evaluating
their utility through recognition and generation tasks. We produce a dataset of
LLM-generated MIDI files without relying on explicit musical training. We then
train neural networks entirely on this LLM-generated MIDI dataset and perform
genre and style classification as well as melody completion, benchmarking their
performance against established models. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can
infer rudimentary musical structures and temporal relationships from text,
highlighting both their potential to implicitly encode musical patterns and
their limitations due to a lack of explicit musical context, shedding light on
their generative capabilities for symbolic music.

                                        <span>  Learning-based lossless compressors play a crucial role in large-scale
genomic database backup, storage, transmission, and management. However, their
1) inadequate compression ratio, 2) low compression \& decompression
throughput, and 3) poor compression robustness limit their widespread adoption
and application in both industry and academia. To solve those challenges, we
propose a novel \underline{P}arallel \underline{M}ulti-\underline{K}nowledge
\underline{L}earning-based \underline{C}ompressor (PMKLC) with four crucial
designs: 1) We propose an automated multi-knowledge learning-based compression
framework as compressors' backbone to enhance compression ratio and robustness;
2) we design a GPU-accelerated ($s$,$k$)-mer encoder to optimize compression
throughput and computing resource usage; 3) we introduce data block
partitioning and Step-wise Model Passing (SMP) mechanisms for parallel
acceleration; 4) We design two compression modes PMKLC-S and PMKLC-M to meet
the complex application scenarios, where the former runs on a
resource-constrained single GPU and the latter is multi-GPU accelerated. We
benchmark PMKLC-S/M and 14 baselines (7 traditional and 7 leaning-based) on 15
real-world datasets with different species and data sizes. Compared to
baselines on the testing datasets, PMKLC-S/M achieve the average compression
ratio improvement up to 73.609\% and 73.480\%, the average throughput
improvement up to 3.036$\times$ and 10.710$\times$, respectively. Besides,
PMKLC-S/M also achieve the best robustness and competitive memory cost,
indicating its greater stability against datasets with different probability
distribution perturbations, and its strong ability to run on memory-constrained
devices.

                                        <span>  Time series prediction, a crucial task across various domains, faces
significant challenges due to the inherent complexities of time series data,
including non-stationarity, multi-scale periodicity, and transient dynamics,
particularly when tackling long-term predictions. While Transformer-based
architectures have shown promise, their quadratic complexity with sequence
length hinders their efficiency for long-term predictions. Recent advancements
in State-Space Models, such as Mamba, offer a more efficient alternative for
long-term modeling, but they cannot capture multi-scale periodicity and
transient dynamics effectively. Meanwhile, they are susceptible to data noise
issues in time series. This paper proposes a novel framework, FLDmamba (Fourier
and Laplace Transform Decomposition Mamba), addressing these limitations.
FLDmamba leverages the strengths of both Fourier and Laplace transforms to
effectively capture both multi-scale periodicity, transient dynamics within
time series data, and improve the robustness of the model to the data noise
issue. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that FLDmamba achieves superior
performance on time series prediction benchmarks, outperforming both
Transformer-based and other Mamba-based architectures. To promote the
reproducibility of our method, we have made both the code and data accessible

                                        <span>  Scene understanding enables intelligent agents to interpret and comprehend
their environment. While existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) for
scene understanding have primarily focused on indoor household tasks, they face
two significant limitations when applied to outdoor large-scale scene
understanding. First, outdoor scenarios typically encompass larger-scale
environments observed through various sensors from multiple viewpoints (e.g.,
bird view and terrestrial view), while existing indoor LVLMs mainly analyze
single visual modalities within building-scale contexts from humanoid
viewpoints. Second, existing LVLMs suffer from missing multidomain perception
outdoor data and struggle to effectively integrate 2D and 3D visual
information. To address the aforementioned limitations, we build the first
multidomain perception outdoor scene understanding dataset, named
\textbf{\underline{SVM-City}}, deriving from multi\textbf{\underline{S}}cale
scenarios with multi\textbf{\underline{V}}iew and
multi\textbf{\underline{M}}odal instruction tuning data. It contains $420$k
images and $4, 811$M point clouds with $567$k question-answering pairs from
vehicles, low-altitude drones, high-altitude aerial planes, and satellite. To
effectively fuse the multimodal data in the absence of one modality, we
introduce incomplete multimodal learning to model outdoor scene understanding
and design the LVLM named \textbf{\underline{City-VLM}}. Multimodal fusion is
realized by constructing a joint probabilistic distribution space rather than
implementing directly explicit fusion operations (e.g., concatenation).
Experimental results on three typical outdoor scene understanding tasks show
City-VLM achieves $18.14 \%$ performance surpassing existing LVLMs in
question-answering tasks averagely. Our method demonstrates pragmatic and
generalization performance across multiple outdoor scenes.

traditional methods for image anomaly detection, such as visual inspection by
human experts, are becoming impractical. We introduce a machine-learning-based
approach to detect poor-quality exposures in large imaging surveys, with a
focus on the DECam Legacy Survey (DECaLS) in regions of low extinction (i.e.,
$E(B-V)<0.04$). Our semi-supervised pipeline integrates a vision transformer
(ViT), trained via self-supervised learning (SSL), with a k-Nearest Neighbor
(kNN) classifier. We train and validate our pipeline using a small set of
labeled exposures observed by surveys with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam). A
clustering-space analysis of where our pipeline places images labeled in
``good'' and ``bad'' categories suggests that our approach can efficiently and
accurately determine the quality of exposures. Applied to new imaging being
reduced for DECaLS Data Release 11, our pipeline identifies 780 problematic
exposures, which we subsequently verify through visual inspection. Being highly
efficient and adaptable, our method offers a scalable solution for quality
control in other large imaging surveys.

transforming healthcare through the analysis and modeling of electronic health
records (EHRs). However, the inherent heterogeneity, temporal irregularity, and
domain-specific nature of EHR data present unique challenges that differ
fundamentally from those in vision and natural language tasks. This survey
offers a comprehensive overview of recent advancements at the intersection of
deep learning, large language models (LLMs), and EHR modeling. We introduce a
unified taxonomy that spans five key design dimensions: data-centric
approaches, neural architecture design, learning-focused strategies, multimodal
learning, and LLM-based modeling systems. Within each dimension, we review
representative methods addressing data quality enhancement, structural and
temporal representation, self-supervised learning, and integration with
clinical knowledge. We further highlight emerging trends such as foundation
models, LLM-driven clinical agents, and EHR-to-text translation for downstream
reasoning. Finally, we discuss open challenges in benchmarking, explainability,
clinical alignment, and generalization across diverse clinical settings. This
survey aims to provide a structured roadmap for advancing AI-driven EHR
modeling and clinical decision support. For a comprehensive list of EHR-related

but its time-consuming generation process remains a challenge due to the
quadratic complexity of attention operations. Recent token merging methods
improve efficiency by reducing the number of tokens during attention
operations, but often overlook the characteristics of attention-based image
generation models, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose
local representative token guided merging (ReToM), a novel token merging
strategy applicable to any attention mechanism in image generation. To merge
tokens based on various contextual information, ReToM defines local boundaries
as windows within attention inputs and adjusts window sizes. Furthermore, we
introduce a representative token, which represents the most representative
token per window by computing similarity at a specific timestep and selecting
the token with the highest average similarity. This approach preserves the most
salient local features while minimizing computational overhead. Experimental
results show that ReToM achieves a 6.2% improvement in FID and higher CLIP
scores compared to the baseline, while maintaining comparable inference time.
We empirically demonstrate that ReToM is effective in balancing visual quality
and computational efficiency.

levels of abstraction in an end-to-end fashion through a learned routing
mechanism. Focusing on low-level linguistic abstraction, we trained our model
as a byte-level language model. Our model spontaneously learns to tokenize
bytes, producing fewer concept tokens than Byte-level Byte Pair Encoder (BBPE)
tokenizers while keeping comparable performance. By comparing with Llama3, we
observed an advantage of Synergy under the same model scale and training
dataset size. Further studies show that the middle part (the higher abstraction
part) of our model performs better when positional encodings are removed,
suggesting the emergence of position-independent concepts. These findings
demonstrate the feasibility of tokenizer-free architectures, paving the way for
more robust and flexible pipelines.

have emerged as potential tools to support older adults' caregiving. Prior
research has explored agent autonomy by identifying key interaction stages in
task processes and defining the agent's role at each stage. However, ensuring
that agents align with older adults' autonomy preferences remains a critical
challenge. Drawing on interdisciplinary conceptualizations of autonomy, this
paper examines four key dimensions of autonomy for older adults:
decision-making autonomy, goal-oriented autonomy, control autonomy, and social
responsibility autonomy. This paper then proposes the following research
directions: (1) Addressing social responsibility autonomy, which concerns the
ethical and social implications of agent use in communal settings; (2)
Operationalizing agent autonomy from the task perspective; and (3) Developing
autonomy measures.

the intersection of computer vision and multimodal artificial intelligence,
with its core value lying in enhancing human-computer interaction through
immersive and empathetic engagement.With the advancement of multimodal large
language models, the driving signals for emotional talking-head generation has
shifted from audio and video to more flexible text. However, current
text-driven methods rely on predefined discrete emotion label texts,
oversimplifying the dynamic complexity of real facial muscle movements and thus
failing to achieve natural emotional expressiveness.This study proposes the
Think-Before-Draw framework to address two key challenges: (1) In-depth
semantic parsing of emotions--by innovatively introducing Chain-of-Thought
(CoT), abstract emotion labels are transformed into physiologically grounded
facial muscle movement descriptions, enabling the mapping from high-level
semantics to actionable motion features; and (2) Fine-grained expressiveness
optimization--inspired by artists' portrait painting process, a progressive
guidance denoising strategy is proposed, employing a "global emotion
localization--local muscle control" mechanism to refine micro-expression
dynamics in generated videos.Our experiments demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on widely-used benchmarks, including MEAD
and HDTF. Additionally, we collected a set of portrait images to evaluate our
model's zero-shot generation capability.

hierarchical state space atlas, effectively modeling macroscopic inter-organ
topological relationships and microscopic contour refinements. We introduce a
snake-specific vision state space module, the Mamba Evolution Block (MEB),
which leverages effective spatiotemporal information aggregation for adaptive
refinement of complex morphologies. Energy map shape priors further ensure
robust long-range contour evolution in heterogeneous data. Additionally, a
dual-classification synergy mechanism is incorporated to concurrently optimize
detection and segmentation, mitigating under-segmentation of microstructures in
UMIS. Extensive evaluations across five clinical datasets reveal Mamba Snake's
superior performance, with an average Dice improvement of 3\% over
state-of-the-art methods.

                                        <span>  Large reasoning models (LRMs) can do complex reasoning via long
chain-of-thought (CoT) involving cognitive strategies such as backtracking and
self-correction. Recent studies suggest that some models inherently possess
these long reasoning abilities, which may be unlocked via extra training. Our
work first investigates whether we can elicit such behavior without any
training. To this end, we propose a decoding-time approach, ThinkLogit, which
utilizes logits arithmetic (Liu et al., 2024) to tune a target large LM for
long reasoning using a substantially smaller model as guider. We then show that
we can further boost performance by training the guider model with preference
optimization over correct/incorrect reasoning pairs sampled from both the
target and guider model -- a setup we refer to as ThinkLogit-DPO. Our
experiments demonstrate that ThinkLogit and ThinkLogit-DPO achieve a relative
improvement in pass@1 by 26% and 29%, respectively, over four mathematical
datasets using the Qwen2.5-32B when guided by R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B -- a model
21x smaller. Lastly, we show that ThinkLogit can transfer long reasoning skills
acquired through reinforcement learning, improving pass@1 by 13% relative
compared to the Qwen2.5-32B base model. Our work presents a
computationally-efficient method to elicit long reasoning in large models with
minimal or no additional training.

of transformer-based models, significantly enhancing multimodal representation

impacted various speech/audio tasks. While high-fidelity reconstruction is
paramount for human perception, audio coding for machines (ACoM) prioritizes
efficient compression and downstream task performance, disregarding perceptual
nuances. This work introduces an efficient ACoM method that can compress and
quantize any chosen intermediate feature representation of an already trained
speech/audio downstream model. Our approach employs task-specific loss guidance
alongside residual vector quantization (RVQ) losses, providing ultra-low
bitrates (i.e., less than 200 bps) with a minimal loss of the downstream model
performance. The resulting tokenizer is adaptable to various bitrates and model
sizes for flexible deployment. Evaluated on automatic speech recognition and
audio classification, our method demonstrates its efficacy and potential for
broader task and architectural applicability through appropriate
regularization.

                                        <span>  LLMs are ideal for decision-making thanks to their ability to reason over
long contexts. However, challenges arise when processing speech transcripts
that describe complex scenarios, as they are verbose and include repetition,
hedging, and vagueness. E.g., during a company's earnings call, an executive
might project a positive revenue outlook to reassure investors, despite
uncertainty regarding future earnings. It is crucial for LLMs to incorporate
this uncertainty systematically when making decisions. In this paper, we
introduce \textsc{DeFine}, a modular framework that constructs probabilistic
factor profiles from complex scenarios. It then integrates these profiles with
analogical reasoning, leveraging insights from similar past experiences to
guide LLMs in making critical decisions in new situations. Our framework
separates the tasks of quantifying uncertainty and incorporating it into LLM
decision-making. This approach is particularly useful in areas such as
consulting and financial deliberation, where making decisions under uncertainty
is vital.

of distributed machine learning, enabling multiple clients such as mobile
devices, edge nodes, or organizations to collaboratively train a shared global
model without the need to centralize sensitive data. This decentralized
approach addresses growing concerns around data privacy, security, and
regulatory compliance, making it particularly attractive in domains such as
healthcare, finance, and smart IoT systems. This survey provides a concise yet
comprehensive overview of Federated Learning, beginning with its core
architecture and communication protocol. We discuss the standard FL lifecycle,
including local training, model aggregation, and global updates. A particular
emphasis is placed on key technical challenges such as handling non-IID
(non-independent and identically distributed) data, mitigating system and
hardware heterogeneity, reducing communication overhead, and ensuring privacy
through mechanisms like differential privacy and secure aggregation.
Furthermore, we examine emerging trends in FL research, including personalized
FL, cross-device versus cross-silo settings, and integration with other
paradigms such as reinforcement learning and quantum computing. We also
highlight real-world applications and summarize benchmark datasets and
evaluation metrics commonly used in FL research. Finally, we outline open
research problems and future directions to guide the development of scalable,

a single dominant platform limits portability, creates vendor lock-in, and
raises barriers for new AI hardware. In this work, we make the case for
combining just-in-time (JIT) compilation with comprehensive kernel parameter
autotuning to enable portable LLM inference with state-of-the-art performance
without code changes. Focusing on performance-critical LLM kernels, we
demonstrate that this approach explores up to 15x more kernel parameter
configurations, produces significantly more diverse code across multiple

230%, all while reducing kernel code size by 70x and eliminating manual code
optimizations. Our results highlight autotuning as a promising path to
unlocking model portability across GPU vendors.

                                        <span>  Real robot data collection for imitation learning has led to significant
advancements in robotic manipulation. However, the requirement for robot
hardware in the process fundamentally constrains the scale of the data. In this
paper, we explore training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using egocentric
human videos. The benefit of using human videos is not only for their scale but
more importantly for the richness of scenes and tasks. With a VLA trained on
human video that predicts human wrist and hand actions, we can perform Inverse
Kinematics and retargeting to convert the human actions to robot actions. We
fine-tune the model using a few robot manipulation demonstrations to obtain the
robot policy, namely EgoVLA. We propose a simulation benchmark called Ego
Humanoid Manipulation Benchmark, where we design diverse bimanual manipulation
tasks with demonstrations. We fine-tune and evaluate EgoVLA with Ego Humanoid
Manipulation Benchmark and show significant improvements over baselines and
ablate the importance of human data. Videos can be found on our website:

                                        <span>  The success of multi-task learning can depend heavily on which tasks are
grouped together. Naively grouping all tasks or a random set of tasks can
result in negative transfer, with the multi-task models performing worse than
single-task models. Though many efforts have been made to identify task
groupings and to measure the relatedness among different tasks, it remains a
challenging research topic to define a metric to identify the best task
grouping out of a pool of many potential task combinations. We propose a metric
of task relatedness based on task difficulty measured by pointwise V-usable
information (PVI). PVI is a recently proposed metric to estimate how much
usable information a dataset contains given a model. We hypothesize that tasks
with not statistically different PVI estimates are similar enough to benefit
from the joint learning process. We conduct comprehensive experiments to
evaluate the feasibility of this metric for task grouping on 15 NLP datasets in
the general, biomedical, and clinical domains. We compare the results of the
joint learners against single learners, existing baseline methods, and recent
large language models, including Llama 2 and GPT-4. The results show that by
grouping tasks with similar PVI estimates, the joint learners yielded
competitive results with fewer total parameters, with consistent performance
across domains.

                                        <span>  Modern neural networks (NNs) often do not generalize well in the presence of
a "covariate shift"; that is, in situations where the training and test data
distributions differ, but the conditional distribution of classification labels
remains unchanged. In such cases, NN generalization can be reduced to a problem
of learning more domain-invariant features. Domain adaptation (DA) methods
include a range of techniques aimed at achieving this; however, these methods
have struggled with the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning, which then
incurs significant computational costs. In this work, we introduce SIDDA, an
out-of-the-box DA training algorithm built upon the Sinkhorn divergence, that
can achieve effective domain alignment with minimal hyperparameter tuning and
computational overhead. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on multiple
simulated and real datasets of varying complexity, including simple shapes,
handwritten digits, and real astronomical observations. SIDDA is compatible
with a variety of NN architectures, and it works particularly well in improving
classification accuracy and model calibration when paired with equivariant
neural networks (ENNs). We find that SIDDA enhances the generalization
capabilities of NNs, achieving up to a $\approx40\%$ improvement in
classification accuracy on unlabeled target data. We also study the efficacy of
DA on ENNs with respect to the varying group orders of the dihedral group
$D_N$, and find that the model performance improves as the degree of
equivariance increases. Finally, we find that SIDDA enhances model calibration
on both source and target data--achieving over an order of magnitude
improvement in the ECE and Brier score. SIDDA's versatility, combined with its
automated approach to domain alignment, has the potential to advance
multi-dataset studies by enabling the development of highly generalizable
models.

abilities and powerful image-understanding capabilities. However, the existing
open-source multi-modal models suffer from the weak capability of multi-turn
interaction, especially for long contexts. To address the issue, we first
introduce a context modeling module, termed ContextQFormer, which utilizes a
memory block to enhance the presentation of contextual information.
Furthermore, to facilitate further research, we carefully build a new
multi-turn multi-modal dialogue dataset (TMDialog) for pre-training,
instruction-tuning, and evaluation, which will be open-sourced lately. Compared
with other multi-modal dialogue datasets, TMDialog contains longer
conversations, which supports the research of multi-turn multi-modal dialogue.
In addition, ContextQFormer is compared with three baselines on TMDialog and
experimental results illustrate that ContextQFormer achieves an improvement of
2%-4% in available rate over baselines.

interest in teleoperating low-cost manipulators to collect demonstration data.
However, most existing systems rely on unilateral control, which only transmits
target position values. While this approach is easy to implement and suitable
for slow, non-contact tasks, it struggles with fast or contact-rich operations
due to the absence of force feedback. This work demonstrates that fast
teleoperation with force feedback is feasible even with force-sensorless,
low-cost manipulators by leveraging 4-channel bilateral control. Based on
accurately identified manipulator dynamics, our method integrates nonlinear
terms compensation, velocity and external force estimation, and variable gain
corresponding to inertial variation. Furthermore, using data collected by
4-channel bilateral control, we show that incorporating force information into
both the input and output of learned policies improves performance in imitation
learning. These results highlight the practical effectiveness of our system for
high-fidelity teleoperation and data collection on affordable hardware.

many in the robotics community are looking for ways to contribute. This paper
presents a roadmap for climate-relevant robotics research, identifying
high-impact opportunities for collaboration between roboticists and experts
across climate domains such as energy, the built environment, transportation,
industry, land use, and Earth sciences. These applications include problems
such as energy systems optimization, construction, precision agriculture,
building envelope retrofits, autonomous trucking, and large-scale environmental
monitoring. Critically, we include opportunities to apply not only physical
robots but also the broader robotics toolkit - including planning, perception,

goal of this roadmap is to inspire new research directions and collaboration by
highlighting specific, actionable problems at the intersection of robotics and
climate. This work represents a collaboration between robotics researchers and

                                        <span>  Popular PEFT methods reduce trainable parameter count for fine-tuning by
parameterizing new low-rank or sparse trainable weights in parallel to the
frozen pre-trained weights $W$. However, these weights are trained from
scratch, and there exists a performance gap between these methods and full
fine-tuning, especially in low-budget settings. We introduce VectorFit, a new
way of parameterization that efficiently utilizes the existing knowledge
embedded in $W$ by adaptively training their singular vectors and biases. We
show that utilizing the structural and transformational properties of $W$ in
this way can lead to high-rank incremental weight matrices $\Delta W$,
comparable to that of full fine-tuning. VectorFit delivers superior results
with \textbf{9$\boldsymbol\times$} fewer trainable parameters than the leading
PEFT methods. Through comprehensive experiments across 19 datasets covering a
wide range of language and vision tasks such as natural language understanding
and generation, question answering, image classification, and image generation,
we demonstrate that VectorFit surpasses baselines in terms of performance as a
function of parameter-efficiency.

                                        <span>  Unstructured clinical data can serve as a unique and rich source of
information that can meaningfully inform clinical practice. Extracting the most
pertinent context from such data is critical for exploiting its true potential
toward optimal and timely decision-making in patient care. While prior research
has explored various methods for clinical text summarization, most prior
studies either process all input tokens uniformly or rely on heuristic-based
filters, which can overlook nuanced clinical cues and fail to prioritize
information critical for decision-making. In this study, we propose Contextual,
a novel framework that integrates a Context-Preserving Token Filtering method
with a Domain-Specific Knowledge Graph (KG) for contextual augmentation. By
preserving context-specific important tokens and enriching them with structured
knowledge, ConTextual improves both linguistic coherence and clinical fidelity.
Our extensive empirical evaluations on two public benchmark datasets
demonstrate that ConTextual consistently outperforms other baselines. Our
proposed approach highlights the complementary role of token-level filtering
and structured retrieval in enhancing both linguistic and clinical integrity,
as well as offering a scalable solution for improving precision in clinical
text generation.

instability and inefficiency, creating significant challenges for
practitioners. Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) algorithms have been developed
to address this issue, among them Population-Based Training (PBT) stands out
for its ability to generate hyperparameters schedules instead of fixed
configurations. PBT trains a population of agents, each with its own
hyperparameters, frequently ranking them and replacing the worst performers
with mutations of the best agents. These intermediate selection steps can cause
PBT to focus on short-term improvements, leading it to get stuck in local
optima and eventually fall behind vanilla Random Search over longer timescales.
This paper studies how this greediness issue is connected to the choice of
evolution frequency, the rate at which the selection is done. We propose
Multiple-Frequencies Population-Based Training (MF-PBT), a novel HPO algorithm
that addresses greediness by employing sub-populations, each evolving at
distinct frequencies. MF-PBT introduces a migration process to transfer
information between sub-populations, with an asymmetric design to balance short
and long-term optimization. Extensive experiments on the Brax suite demonstrate
that MF-PBT improves sample efficiency and long-term performance, even without
actually tuning hyperparameters.

Autonomous Driving (AD) policies, reducing the engineering overhead of
rule-based approaches. Imitation Learning (IL) remains the dominant paradigm,
benefiting from large-scale human demonstration datasets, but it suffers from
inherent limitations such as distribution shift and imitation gaps.
Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a promising alternative, yet its adoption
in AD remains limited due to the lack of standardized and efficient research
frameworks. To this end, we introduce V-Max, an open research framework
providing all the necessary tools to make RL practical for AD. V-Max is built
on Waymax, a hardware-accelerated AD simulator designed for large-scale
experimentation. We extend it using ScenarioNet's approach, enabling the fast
simulation of diverse AD datasets.

for the most part, coming from their input conditioning. This paper
investigates the representation used to condition diffusion models from the
perspective that ideal representations should improve sample fidelity, be easy
to generate, and be compositional to allow out-of-training samples generation.
We introduce Discrete Latent Code (DLC), an image representation derived from
Simplicial Embeddings trained with a self-supervised learning objective. DLCs
are sequences of discrete tokens, as opposed to the standard continuous image
embeddings. They are easy to generate and their compositionality enables
sampling of novel images beyond the training distribution. Diffusion models
trained with DLCs have improved generation fidelity, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for unconditional image generation on ImageNet. Additionally,
we show that composing DLCs allows the image generator to produce
out-of-distribution samples that coherently combine the semantics of images in
diverse ways. Finally, we showcase how DLCs can enable text-to-image generation
by leveraging large-scale pretrained language models. We efficiently finetune a
text diffusion language model to generate DLCs that produce novel samples
outside of the image generator training distribution.

standard error rate averaged over all classes. For example, a three-class
classification task with class-wise error rates of 10%, 10%, and 40% has a
worst-class error rate of 40%, whereas the average is 20% under the
class-balanced condition. The worst-class error is important in many
applications. For example, in a medical image classification task, it would not
be acceptable for the malignant tumor class to have a 40% error rate, while the
benign and healthy classes have a 10% error rates. To avoid overfitting in
worst-class error minimization using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), we design a
problem formulation for bounding the worst-class error instead of achieving
zero worst-class error. Moreover, to correctly bound the worst-class error, we
propose a boosting approach which ensembles DNNs. We give training and
generalization worst-class-error bound. Experimental results show that the
algorithm lowers worst-class test error rates while avoiding overfitting to the
training set. This code is available at

amateur photos faces challenges in maintaining facial resemblance. This paper
evaluates the impact of augmentation strategies on two personalization methods:
DreamBooth and InstantID. We compare classical augmentations (flipping,
cropping, color adjustments) with generative augmentation using InstantID's
synthetic images to enrich training data. Using SDXL and a new FaceDistance
metric based on FaceNet, we quantitatively assess facial similarity. Results
show classical augmentations can cause artifacts harming identity retention,
while InstantID improves fidelity when balanced with real images to avoid
overfitting. A user study with 97 participants confirms high photorealism and
preferences for InstantID's polished look versus DreamBooth's identity
accuracy. Our findings inform effective augmentation strategies for
personalized text-to-image generation.

widely used SWE-bench dataset. Recent studies have uncovered severe data
contamination issues, e.g. SWE-bench reports 32.67% of successful patches
involve direct solution leakage and 31.08% pass due to inadequate test cases.
We introduce SWE-MERA, a dynamic, continuously updated benchmark designed to
address these fundamental challenges through an automated collection of
real-world GitHub issues and rigorous quality validation. Our approach
implements a reliable pipeline that ensures quality while minimizing
contamination risks, resulting in approximately 10,000 potential tasks with 300

demonstrates strong discriminative power in state-of-the-art models. We report
performance across a dozen recent LLMs evaluated on tasks collected between

                                        <span>  Post-training quantization (PTQ) reduces a model's memory footprint by
mapping full precision weights into low bit weights without costly retraining,
but can degrade its downstream performance especially in low 2- to 3-bit
settings. We develop a new mixed-precision PTQ approach, Task-Circuit
Quantization (TaCQ), that draws parallels to automated circuit discovery,
directly conditioning the quantization process on specific weight circuits --
which we define as sets of weights associated with downstream task performance.
These weights are kept as 16-bit weights, while others are quantized,
maintaining performance while only adding a marginal memory cost. Specifically,
TaCQ contrasts unquantized model weights with a uniformly-quantized model to
estimate the expected change in weights due to quantization and uses gradient
information to predict the resulting impact on task performance, allowing us to
preserve task-specific weights. We compare TaCQ-based quantization to existing
mixed-precision quantization methods when conditioning both on general-purpose
and task-specific data. Across QA, math reasoning, and text-to-SQL tasks for
both Llama-3 and Qwen2.5, we find that TaCQ outperforms baselines using the
same calibration data and a lower weight budget, achieving major improvements
in the 2 and 3-bit regime. With only 3.1 bits we are able to recover 96% of
Llama-3-8B-Instruct's unquantized 16-bit MMLU performance, obtaining a 5.25%
absolute improvement over SPQR. We also observe consistently large gains over
existing methods in the 2-bit regime, with an average gain of 14.74% over the
strongest baseline, SliM-LLM. Moreover, we observe a 7.20% gain without
conditioning on specific tasks, showing TaCQ's ability to identify important
weights is not limited to task-conditioned settings.

Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) might generate hallucinated contents that do not
exist in the given image. Most existing LVLM hallucination benchmarks are
constrained to evaluate the object-related hallucinations. However, the
potential hallucination on the relations between two objects, i.e., relation
hallucination, still lacks investigation. To remedy that, we design a unified
framework to measure the object and relation hallucination in LVLMs
simultaneously. The core idea of our framework is to evaluate hallucinations
via (object, relation, object) triplets extracted from LVLMs' responses, making
it easily generalizable to different vision-language tasks. Based on our
framework, we further introduce Tri-HE, a novel Triplet-level Hallucination
Evaluation benchmark which can be used to study both object and relation
hallucination at the same time. With comprehensive evaluations on Tri-HE, we
observe that the relation hallucination issue is even more serious than object
hallucination among existing LVLMs, highlighting a previously neglected problem
towards reliable LVLMs. Moreover, based on our findings, we design a simple
training-free approach that effectively mitigates hallucinations for LVLMs. Our
dataset and code for the reproduction of our experiments are available publicly
at https://github.com/wujunjie1998/Tri-HE.

                                        <span>  Large reasoning models (LRMs) have exhibited remarkable reasoning
capabilities through inference-time scaling, but this progress has also
introduced considerable redundancy and inefficiency into their reasoning
processes, resulting in substantial computational waste. Previous work has
attempted to mitigate this issue by penalizing the overall length of generated
samples during reinforcement learning (RL), with the goal of encouraging a more
concise chains of thought. However, we observe that such global length penalty
often lead to excessive compression of critical reasoning steps while
preserving unnecessary details in simpler ones, yielding a suboptimal trade-off
between accuracy and efficiency. To address this issue, we propose
SmartThinker, a two-stage learnable framework designed to enable fine-grained
control over the length of reasoning chains based on the importance of each
individual step. In the first stage, SmartThinker adapts a reasoning model to a
short-form reasoning mode through rejection sampling combined with supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, SmartThinker applies Step-Level Length
Control Policy Optimization (SCPO) to refine the model output distribution,
which increases the proportion of length allocated to critical steps while
reducing redundancy in less important ones. SCPO consists of four core
components: an online importance estimator, a step-level length control reward
function, a step-level generalized advantage estimation (S-GAE) and a
difficulty-adaptive clipping strategy. Working in concert, these components
enable SCPO to implement differentiated length control across reasoning steps.
Empirical results across multiple reasoning benchmarks and various backbone
models demonstrate that SmartThinker significantly reduces redundant reasoning
while achieving comparable or even superior performance to existing methods.

introduce J1-ENVS, the first interactive and dynamic legal environment tailored

with procedural execution in dynamic settings. Even the SOTA model, GPT-4o,
falls short of 60% overall performance. These findings highlight persistent
challenges in achieving dynamic legal intelligence and offer valuable insights

however, current evaluations primarily focus on natural language tasks,
overlooking code quality. Most benchmarks prioritize high-level reasoning over
executable code and real-world performance, leaving gaps in understanding true
capabilities and risks associated with these models in production. To address
this issue, we propose MERA Code, a new addition to the MERA benchmark family,
specifically focused on evaluating code for the latest code generation LLMs in
Russian. This benchmark includes 11 evaluation tasks that span 8 programming
languages. Our proposed evaluation methodology features a taxonomy that
outlines the practical coding skills necessary for models to complete these
tasks. The benchmark comprises an open-source codebase for users to conduct
MERA assessments, a scoring system compatible with various programming
environments, and a platform featuring a leaderboard and submission system. We
evaluate open LLMs and frontier API models, analyzing their limitations in
terms of practical coding tasks in non-English languages. We are publicly
releasing MERA to guide future research, anticipate groundbreaking features in
model development, and standardize evaluation procedures.

                                        <span>  The increasing interest in developing Artificial Intelligence applications in
the medical domain, suffers from the lack of high-quality data set, mainly due
to privacy-related issues. In addition, the recent increase in Vision Language
Models (VLM) leads to the need for multimodal medical data sets, where clinical
reports and findings are attached to the corresponding medical scans. This
paper illustrates the entire workflow for building the MedPix 2.0 data set.
Starting with the well-known multimodal data set
MedPix\textsuperscript{\textregistered}, mainly used by physicians, nurses, and
healthcare students for Continuing Medical Education purposes, a semi-automatic
pipeline was developed to extract visual and textual data followed by a manual
curing procedure in which noisy samples were removed, thus creating a MongoDB
database. Along with the data set, we developed a Graphical User Interface
aimed at navigating efficiently the MongoDB instance and obtaining the raw data
that can be easily used for training and/or fine-tuning VLMs. To enforce this
point, in this work, we first recall DR-Minerva, a Retrieve Augmented
Generation-based VLM model trained upon MedPix 2.0. DR-Minerva predicts the
body part and the modality used to scan its input image. We also propose the
extension of DR-Minerva with a Knowledge Graph that uses Llama 3.1 Instruct 8B,
and leverages MedPix 2.0. The resulting architecture can be queried in a
end-to-end manner, as a medical decision support system. MedPix 2.0 is
available on GitHub.

                                        <span>  In recent years, the rampant spread of misinformation on social media has
made accurate detection of multimodal fake news a critical research focus.
However, previous research has not adequately understood the semantics of
images, and models struggle to discern news authenticity with limited textual
information. Meanwhile, treating all emotional types of news uniformly without
tailored approaches further leads to performance degradation. Therefore, we
propose a novel Knowledge Augmentation and Emotion Guidance Network (KEN). On
the one hand, we effectively leverage LVLM's powerful semantic understanding
and extensive world knowledge. For images, the generated captions provide a
comprehensive understanding of image content and scenes, while for text, the
retrieved evidence helps break the information silos caused by the closed and
limited text and context. On the other hand, we consider inter-class
differences between different emotional types of news through balanced
learning, achieving fine-grained modeling of the relationship between emotional
types and authenticity. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our KEN.

RGBD-inertial SLAM for legged robotics undergoing aggressive and high-frequency
motions.By integrating geometric consistency, legged odometry constraints, and
dual-stream optical flow (GeoFlow), our method addresses three critical
challenges:feature matching and pose initialization failures during fast
locomotion and visual feature scarcity in texture-less scenes.Specifically, in
rapid motion scenarios, feature matching is notably enhanced by leveraging
dual-stream optical flow, which combines prior map points and poses.
Additionally, we propose a robust pose initialization method for fast
locomotion and IMU error in legged robots, integrating IMU/Legged odometry,
inter-frame Perspective-n-Point (PnP), and Generalized Iterative Closest Point
(GICP). Furthermore, a novel optimization framework that tightly couples
depth-to-map and GICP geometric constraints is first introduced to improve the
robustness and accuracy in long-duration, visually texture-less environments.
The proposed algorithms achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) on collected legged
robots and open-source datasets. To further promote research and development,
the open-source datasets and code will be made publicly available at

existing pretrained uni-modal models: for example, an image classifier with an
text model. This stitching process is performed by training a connector module
that aims to align the representation spaces of these uni-modal models towards
a multi-modal objective. However, given the complexity of training such
connectors on large scale web-based datasets coupled with the ever-increasing
number of available pretrained uni-modal models, the task of uni-modal models
selection and subsequent connector module training becomes computationally
demanding. To address this under-studied critical problem, we propose
Hypernetwork Model Alignment (Hyma), a novel all-in-one solution for optimal
uni-modal model selection and connector training by leveraging hypernetworks.
Specifically, our framework utilizes the parameter prediction capability of a
hypernetwork to obtain jointly trained connector modules for $N \times M$
combinations of uni-modal models. In our experiments, Hyma reduces the cost of
searching for the best performing uni-modal model pair by $10\times$, while
matching the ranking and trained connector performance obtained via grid search
across a suite of diverse multi-modal benchmarks.

safety-critical domains. Despite the existing knowledge about uncertainty in
risk analysis, no previous work has estimated the uncertainty of AI-augmented
systems given the propagation of errors in the pipeline. We provide the formal
underpinnings for capturing uncertainty propagation, develop a simulator to
quantify uncertainty, and evaluate the simulation of propagating errors with
one case study. We discuss the generalizability of our approach and its
limitations and present recommendations for evaluation policies concerning AI
systems. Future work includes extending the approach by relaxing the remaining
assumptions and by experimenting with a real system.

                                        <span>  Precise segmentation of brain tumors from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is
essential for neuro-oncology diagnosis and treatment planning. Despite advances
in deep learning methods, automatic segmentation remains challenging due to
tumor morphological heterogeneity and complex three-dimensional spatial
relationships. Current techniques primarily rely on visual features extracted
from MRI sequences while underutilizing semantic knowledge embedded in medical
reports. This research presents a multi-level fusion architecture that
integrates pixel-level, feature-level, and semantic-level information,
facilitating comprehensive processing from low-level data to high-level
concepts. The semantic-level fusion pathway combines the semantic understanding
capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models with the
spatial feature extraction advantages of 3D U-Net through three mechanisms:
3D-2D semantic bridging, cross-modal semantic guidance, and semantic-based
attention mechanisms. Experimental validation on the BraTS 2020 dataset
demonstrates that the proposed model achieves an overall Dice coefficient of
0.8567, representing a 4.8% improvement compared to traditional 3D U-Net, with
a 7.3% Dice coefficient increase in the clinically important enhancing tumor
(ET) region.

with the environment. Learning a scene representation for multiple modalities
enhances comprehension of the physical world. However, modality conflicts,
arising from inherent distinctions among different modalities, present two
critical challenges: property disparity and granularity disparity. To address
these challenges, we propose a general framework, MMOne, to represent multiple
modalities in one scene, which can be readily extended to additional
modalities. Specifically, a modality modeling module with a novel modality
indicator is proposed to capture the unique properties of each modality.
Additionally, we design a multimodal decomposition mechanism to separate
multi-modal Gaussians into single-modal Gaussians based on modality
differences. We address the essential distinctions among modalities by
disentangling multimodal information into shared and modality-specific
components, resulting in a more compact and efficient multimodal scene
representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently
enhances the representation capability for each modality and is scalable to
additional modalities. The code is available at

                                        <span>  Modern language agents must operate over long-horizon, multi-turn
interactions, where they retrieve external information, adapt to observations,
and answer interdependent queries. Yet, most LLM systems rely on full-context
prompting, appending all past turns regardless of their relevance. This leads
to unbounded memory growth, increased computational costs, and degraded
reasoning performance on out-of-distribution input lengths. We introduce MEM1,
an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that enables agents to operate
with constant memory across long multi-turn tasks. At each turn, MEM1 updates a
compact shared internal state that jointly supports memory consolidation and
reasoning. This state integrates prior memory with new observations from the
environment while strategically discarding irrelevant or redundant information.
To support training in more realistic and compositional settings, we propose a
simple yet effective and scalable approach to constructing multi-turn
environments by composing existing datasets into arbitrarily complex task
sequences. Experiments across three domains, including internal retrieval QA,
open-domain web QA, and multi-turn web shopping, show that MEM1-7B improves
performance by 3.5x while reducing memory usage by 3.7x compared to
Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct on a 16-objective multi-hop QA task, and generalizes
beyond the training horizon. Our results demonstrate the promise of
reasoning-driven memory consolidation as a scalable alternative to existing
solutions for training long-horizon interactive agents, where both efficiency
and performance are optimized.

                                        <span>  In the realm of large language models (LLMs), the ability of models to
accurately follow instructions is paramount as more agents and applications
leverage LLMs for construction, where the complexity of instructions are
rapidly increasing. However, on the one hand, there is only a certain amount of
complex instruction evaluation data; on the other hand, there are no dedicated
algorithms to improve the ability to follow complex instructions. To this end,
this paper introduces TRACE, a benchmark for improving and evaluating the
complex instructionfollowing ability, which consists of 120K training data and
1K evaluation data. Furthermore, we propose IOPO (Input-Output Preference
Optimization) alignment method which takes both input and output preference
pairs into consideration, where LLMs not only rapidly align with response
preferences but also meticulously explore the instruction preferences.
Extensive experiments on both in-domain and outof-domain datasets confirm the
effectiveness of IOPO, showing 8.15%, 2.18% improvements on in-domain data and
6.29%, 3.13% on outof-domain data compared to SFT and DPO respectively.

aspects for wide-field photometric surveys. Determination of photometric
redshift for galaxies, has been traditionally solved by use of machine-learning
and artificial intelligence techniques trained on a calibration sample of
galaxies, where both photometry and spectrometry are available. On this paper,
we present a new algorithmic approach for determining photometric redshifts of
galaxies using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs). The
proposed implementation is able to determine both point-estimation and
probability-density estimations for photometric redshifts. The methodology is
tested with data from Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y1 data and compared with other
existing algorithm such as a Mixture Density Network (MDN). Although results
obtained show a superiority of MDN, CGAN quality-metrics are close to the MDN
results, opening the door to the use of CGAN at photometric redshift
estimation.

                                        <span>  In this report, we introduce the Gemini 2.X model family: Gemini 2.5 Pro and
Gemini 2.5 Flash, as well as our earlier Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite
models. Gemini 2.5 Pro is our most capable model yet, achieving SoTA
performance on frontier coding and reasoning benchmarks. In addition to its
incredible coding and reasoning skills, Gemini 2.5 Pro is a thinking model that
excels at multimodal understanding and it is now able to process up to 3 hours
of video content. Its unique combination of long context, multimodal and
reasoning capabilities can be combined to unlock new agentic workflows. Gemini
2.5 Flash provides excellent reasoning abilities at a fraction of the compute
and latency requirements and Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite provide high
performance at low latency and cost. Taken together, the Gemini 2.X model
generation spans the full Pareto frontier of model capability vs cost, allowing
users to explore the boundaries of what is possible with complex agentic
problem solving.

                                        <span>  The analysis of high-dimensional timeline data and the identification of
outliers and anomalies is critical across diverse domains, including sensor
readings, biological and medical data, historical records, and global
statistics. However, conventional analysis techniques often struggle with
challenges such as high dimensionality, complex distributions, and sparsity.
These limitations hinder the ability to extract meaningful insights from
complex temporal datasets, making it difficult to identify trending features,
outliers, and anomalies effectively. Inspired by surprisability -- a cognitive
science concept describing how humans instinctively focus on unexpected
deviations - we propose Learning via Surprisability (LvS), a novel approach for
transforming high-dimensional timeline data. LvS quantifies and prioritizes
anomalies in time-series data by formalizing deviations from expected behavior.
LvS bridges cognitive theories of attention with computational methods,
enabling the detection of anomalies and shifts in a way that preserves critical
context, offering a new lens for interpreting complex datasets. We demonstrate
the usefulness of LvS on three high-dimensional timeline use cases: a time
series of sensor data, a global dataset of mortality causes over multiple
years, and a textual corpus containing over two centuries of State of the Union
Addresses by U.S. presidents. Our results show that the LvS transformation
enables efficient and interpretable identification of outliers, anomalies, and
the most variable features along the timeline.

generating non-existing facts, known as hallucination, has garnered increasing
attention. Previous research in enhancing LLM confidence estimation mainly
focuses on the single problem setting. However, LLM awareness of its internal
parameterized knowledge boundary under the more challenging multi-problem
setting, which requires answering multiple problems accurately simultaneously,
remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel method,
Multiple Answers and Confidence Stepwise Tuning (MAC-Tuning), that separates
the learning of answer prediction and confidence estimation during fine-tuning
on instruction data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms baselines by up to 25% in average precision.

                                        <span>  Safety alignment is critical for LLM-powered systems. While recent
LLM-powered guardrail approaches such as LlamaGuard achieve high detection
accuracy of unsafe inputs written in English (e.g., ``How to create a bomb?''),
they struggle with multilingual unsafe inputs. This limitation leaves LLM
systems vulnerable to unsafe and jailbreak prompts written in low-resource
languages such as those in Southeast Asia. This paper introduces SEALGuard, a
multilingual guardrail designed to improve the safety alignment across diverse
languages. It aims to address the multilingual safety alignment gap of existing
guardrails and ensure effective filtering of unsafe and jailbreak prompts in
LLM-powered systems. We adapt a general-purpose multilingual language model
into a multilingual guardrail using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). We construct
SEALSBench, a large-scale multilingual safety alignment dataset containing over
260,000 prompts in ten languages, including safe, unsafe, and jailbreak cases.
We evaluate SEALGuard against state-of-the-art guardrails such as LlamaGuard on
this benchmark. Our findings show that multilingual unsafe and jailbreak
prompts substantially degrade the performance of the state-of-the-art
LlamaGuard, which experiences a drop in Defense Success Rate (DSR) by 9% and
18%, respectively, compared to its performance on English-only prompts. In
contrast, SEALGuard outperforms existing guardrails in detecting multilingual
unsafe and jailbreak prompts, improving DSR by 48% over LlamaGuard and
achieving the best DSR, precision, and F1-score. Our ablation study further
reveals the contributions of adaptation strategies and model size to the
overall performance of SEALGuard. We release our pre-trained model and
benchmark at https://github.com/awsm-research/SEALGuard to support further
research.

perspective, reformulate user-item interactions as graphs to leverage graph
structure and topology to recommend and have proved practical effectiveness at
scale. Large language models, representing a textual generative perspective,
excel at modeling user languages, understanding behavioral contexts, capturing
user-item semantic relationships, analyzing textual sentiments, and generating
coherent and contextually relevant texts as recommendations. However, there is
a gap between the connected graph perspective and the text generation
perspective as the task formulations are different. A research question arises:
how can we effectively integrate the two perspectives for more personalized
recsys? To fill this gap, we propose to incorporate graph-edge information into
LLMs via prompt and attention innovations. We reformulate recommendations as a
probabilistic generative problem using prompts. We develop a framework to
incorporate graph edge information from the prompt and attention mechanisms for
graph-structured LLM recommendations. We develop a new prompt design that
brings in both first-order and second-order graph relationships; we devise an
improved LLM attention mechanism to embed direct the spatial and connectivity
information of edges. Our evaluation of real-world datasets demonstrates the
framework's ability to understand connectivity information in graph data and to
improve the relevance and quality of recommendation results.

                                        <span>  Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease affecting 35% of
extremely low birth weight infants. Defined by oxygen dependence at 36 weeks
postmenstrual age, it causes lifelong respiratory complications. However,
preventive interventions carry severe risks, including neurodevelopmental
impairment, ventilator-induced lung injury, and systemic complications.
Therefore, early BPD prognosis and prediction of BPD outcome is crucial to
avoid unnecessary toxicity in low risk infants. Admission radiographs of
extremely preterm infants are routinely acquired within 24h of life and could
serve as a non-invasive prognostic tool. In this work, we developed and
investigated a deep learning approach using chest X-rays from 163 extremely
low-birth-weight infants ($\leq$32 weeks gestation, 401-999g) obtained within
24 hours of birth. We fine-tuned a ResNet-50 pretrained specifically on adult
chest radiographs, employing progressive layer freezing with discriminative
learning rates to prevent overfitting and evaluated a CutMix augmentation and
linear probing. For moderate/severe BPD outcome prediction, our best performing
model with progressive freezing, linear probing and CutMix achieved an AUROC of
0.78 $\pm$ 0.10, balanced accuracy of 0.69 $\pm$ 0.10, and an F1-score of 0.67
$\pm$ 0.11. In-domain pre-training significantly outperformed ImageNet
initialization (p = 0.031) which confirms domain-specific pretraining to be
important for BPD outcome prediction. Routine IRDS grades showed limited
prognostic value (AUROC 0.57 $\pm$ 0.11), confirming the need of learned
markers. Our approach demonstrates that domain-specific pretraining enables
accurate BPD prediction from routine day-1 radiographs. Through progressive
freezing and linear probing, the method remains computationally feasible for
site-level implementation and future federated learning deployments.

study participants were recruited from 149 candidates to form three groups
representing experts in the domain of mycology (DE), students with a data
science and visualization background (IT) and students from social sciences and
humanities (SSH). The main part of the dataset contains 39 transcripts of
interviews during which participants were asked to complete a series of tasks
and questions related to the interpretation of explanations of decisions of a
machine learning model trained to distinguish between edible and inedible
mushrooms. The transcripts were complemented with additional data that includes
visualizations of explanations presented to the user, results from thematic
analysis, recommendations of improvements of explanations provided by the
participants, and the initial survey results that allow to determine the domain
knowledge of the participant and data analysis literacy. The transcripts were
manually tagged to allow for automatic matching between the text and other data
related to particular fragments. In the advent of the area of rapid development
of XAI techniques, the need for a multidisciplinary qualitative evaluation of
explainability is one of the emerging topics in the community. Our dataset
allows not only to reproduce the study we conducted, but also to open a wide
range of possibilities for the analysis of the material we gathered.

                                        <span>  To alleviate the reliance of deep neural networks on large-scale datasets,
dataset distillation aims to generate compact, high-quality synthetic datasets
that can achieve comparable performance to the original dataset. The
integration of generative models has significantly advanced this field.
However, existing approaches primarily focus on aligning the distilled dataset
with the original one, often overlooking task-specific information that can be
critical for optimal downstream performance. In this paper, focusing on the
downstream task of classification, we propose a task-specific sampling strategy
for generative dataset distillation that incorporates the concept of difficulty
to consider the requirements of the target task better. The final dataset is
sampled from a larger image pool with a sampling distribution obtained by
matching the difficulty distribution of the original dataset. A logarithmic
transformation is applied as a pre-processing step to correct for
distributional bias. The results of extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method and suggest its potential for enhancing performance
on other downstream tasks. The code is available at

(DeepONet) framework for efficient spatio-temporal flow field prediction when
high-fidelity data is scarce. Key innovations include: a merge network
replacing traditional dot-product operations, achieving 50.4% reduction in
prediction error and 7.57% accuracy improvement while reducing training time by
96%; a transfer learning multi-fidelity approach that freezes pre-trained
low-fidelity networks while making only the merge network trainable,
outperforming alternatives by up to 76% and achieving 43.7% better accuracy
than single-fidelity training; and a physics-guided subsampling method that
strategically selects high-fidelity training points based on temporal dynamics,
reducing high-fidelity sample requirements by 40% while maintaining comparable
accuracy. Comprehensive experiments across multiple resolutions and datasets
demonstrate the framework's ability to significantly reduce required
high-fidelity dataset size while maintaining predictive accuracy, with
consistent superior performance against conventional benchmarks.

                                        <span>  Training medical image segmentation models for rare yet clinically important
imaging modalities is challenging due to the scarcity of annotated data, and
manual mask annotations can be costly and labor-intensive to acquire. This
paper investigates leveraging generative models to synthesize data, for
training segmentation models for underrepresented modalities, particularly on
annotation-scarce MRI. Concretely, our contributions are threefold: (i) we
introduce MRGen-DB, a large-scale radiology image-text dataset comprising
extensive samples with rich metadata, including modality labels, attributes,
regions, and organs information, with a subset featuring pixel-wise mask
annotations; (ii) we present MRGen, a diffusion-based data engine for
controllable medical image synthesis, conditioned on text prompts and
segmentation masks. MRGen can generate realistic images for diverse MRI
modalities lacking mask annotations, facilitating segmentation training in
low-source domains; (iii) extensive experiments across multiple modalities
demonstrate that MRGen significantly improves segmentation performance on
unannotated modalities by providing high-quality synthetic data. We believe
that our method bridges a critical gap in medical image analysis, extending
segmentation capabilities to scenarios that are challenging to acquire manual
annotations. The codes, models, and data will be publicly available at

                                        <span>  The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology is
profoundly transforming human society and concurrently presenting a series of
ethical, legal, and social issues. The effective governance of AI has become a
crucial global concern. Since 2022, the extensive deployment of generative AI,
particularly large language models, marked a new phase in AI governance.
Continuous efforts are being made by the international community in actively
addressing the novel challenges posed by these AI developments. As consensus on
international governance continues to be established and put into action, the
practical importance of conducting a global assessment of the state of AI
governance is progressively coming to light. In this context, we initiated the
development of the AI Governance InternationaL Evaluation Index (AGILE Index).
Adhering to the design principle, "the level of governance should match the
level of development," the inaugural evaluation of the AGILE Index commences
with an exploration of four foundational pillars: the development level of AI,
the AI governance environment, the AI governance instruments, and the AI
governance effectiveness. It covers 39 indicators across 18 dimensions to
comprehensively assess the AI governance level of 14 representative countries
globally. The index is utilized to delve into the status of AI governance to
date in 14 countries for the first batch of evaluation. The aim is to depict
the current state of AI governance in these countries through data scoring,
assist them in identifying their governance stage and uncovering governance
issues, and ultimately offer insights for the enhancement of their AI
governance systems.

simple regularity conditions. This generalises prior geometric control theory
methods and clarifies how optimal geodesic estimation can be performed in

Module, designed and implemented by eSapiens, a secure, scalable engine that
transforms natural-language questions into verified, read-only SQL analytics
for enterprise databases. The Text-to-SQL module follows a decoupled
orchestration/execution architecture: a Supervisor Agent routes queries, Schema
Retrieval dynamically injects table and column metadata, and a SQL Generation
Agent emits single-statement SELECT queries protected by a read-only guardrail.
An integrated Self-Correction & Rating loop captures empty results, execution
errors, or low-quality outputs and triggers up to five LLM-driven regeneration
attempts. Finally, a Result Interpretation Agent produces concise,
human-readable insights and hands raw rows to the Insight & Intelligence engine
for visualization or forecasting.
  Smoke tests across finance, sales, and operations scenarios demonstrate
reliable ad-hoc querying and automated periodic reporting. By embedding schema
awareness, fault-tolerant execution, and compliance guardrails, the THOR Module
empowers non-technical users to access live data with zero-SQL simplicity and
enterprise-grade safety.

                                        <span>  Generative adversarial attacks train a perturbation generator on a white-box
surrogate model and subsequently apply the crafted perturbations to unseen
black-box victim models. In contrast to iterative attacks, these methods
deliver superior inference-time efficiency, scalability, and transferability;
however, up until now, existing studies have not fully exploited the
representational capacity of generative models to preserve and harness semantic
information. Specifically, the intermediate activations of the generator encode
rich semantic features--object boundaries and coarse shapes--that remain
under-exploited, thereby limiting the alignment of perturbations with
object-salient regions which are critical for adversarial transferability. To
remedy this, we introduce a semantic structure-aware attack framework based on
the Mean Teacher, which serves as a temporally smoothed feature reference. With
this smoothed reference, we further direct semantic consistency between the
early-layer activations in the student and those of the semantically rich
teacher by feature distillation. By anchoring perturbation synthesis to the
semantically salient early intermediate blocks within the generator based on
empirical findings, our method guides progressive adversarial perturbation on
regions that substantially enhance adversarial transferability. We conduct
extensive experiments over diverse models, domains and tasks to demonstrate
consistent improvements relative to state-of-the-art generative attacks,
comprehensively evaluated using conventional metrics and our newly proposed
Accidental Correction Rate (ACR).

                                        <span>  Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable code generation capabilities
but falter when adapting to frequent updates in external library APIs. This
critical limitation, stemming from reliance on outdated API knowledge from
their training data, even with access to current documentation, impedes
reliable code generation in dynamic environments. To tackle this issue, we
propose ReCode (rule-based Reinforcement learning for Code Update), a novel
framework that mimics human programmer adaptation to API changes. Specifically,
we construct a dataset of approximately 2,000 data entries to train the LLMs to
perform version migration based on updated information. Then, we introduce a
modified string similarity metric for code evaluation as the reward for
reinforcement learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ReCode substantially
boosts LLMs' code generation performance in dynamic API scenarios, especially
on the unseen CodeUpdateArena task. Crucially, compared to supervised
fine-tuning, ReCode has less impact on LLMs' general code generation abilities.
We apply ReCode on various LLMs and reinforcement learning algorithms (GRPO and
DAPO), all achieving consistent improvements. Notably, after training,
Qwen2.5-Coder-7B outperforms that of the 32B parameter code instruction-tuned
model and the reasoning model with the same architecture. Code is available at

dynamics network to predict the environment dynamics for planning, without
relying on simulators. However, the latent states learned by the dynamics
network make its planning process opaque. This paper aims to demystify MuZero's
model by interpreting the learned latent states. We incorporate observation
reconstruction and state consistency into MuZero training and conduct an
in-depth analysis to evaluate latent states across two board games: 9x9 Go and
Gomoku, and three Atari games: Breakout, Ms. Pacman, and Pong. Our findings
reveal that while the dynamics network becomes less accurate over longer
simulations, MuZero still performs effectively by using planning to correct
errors. Our experiments also show that the dynamics network learns better
latent states in board games than in Atari games. These insights contribute to
a better understanding of MuZero and offer directions for future research to
improve the performance, robustness, and interpretability of the MuZero
algorithm. The code and data are available at

                                        <span>  Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) with numerical feedback, such
as scalar rewards, have significantly enhanced the complex reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite this success, we identify
three key challenges encountered by RL with solely numerical feedback:
performance plateaus, limited effectiveness of spontaneous self-reflection, and
persistent failures. We then demonstrate that RL-finetuned models, even after
exhibiting performance plateaus, can generate correct refinements on
persistently failed problems by leveraging natural language feedback in the
form of critiques. Building on this insight, we propose Critique-GRPO, an
online RL framework that integrates both natural language and numerical
feedback for effective policy optimization. Critique-GRPO enables LLMs to learn
from initial responses and critique-guided self-refinements simultaneously
while maintaining exploration. Additionally, we employ a shaping function to
amplify learning from correct, especially unfamiliar, refinements and penalize
incorrect ones. Extensive experiments with Qwen2.5-7B-Base,
Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base, and Qwen3-8B demonstrate that Critique-GRPO consistently
outperforms supervised learning and RL-based fine-tuning methods across eight
challenging mathematical, STEM, and general reasoning tasks, improving average
pass@1 scores by approximately 4.4% and 3.8% on Qwen2.5-7B-Base and Qwen3-8B,
respectively. Notably, Critique-GRPO enables effective self-improvement through
self-critiquing and weak-to-strong generalization, achieving consistent gains
over GRPO, such as 16.7% and 10.0% pass@1 improvements on AIME 2024,
respectively.

We introduce VIDEE, a system that supports entry-level data analysts to conduct

human-agent collaroration workflow consisting of three stages: (1)
Decomposition, which incorporates a human-in-the-loop Monte-Carlo Tree Search
algorithm to support generative reasoning with human feedback, (2) Execution,
which generates an executable text analytics pipeline, and (3) Evaluation,
which integrates LLM-based evaluation and visualizations to support user
validation of execution results. We conduct two quantitative experiments to
evaluate VIDEE's effectiveness and analyze common agent errors. A user study
involving participants with varying levels of NLP and text analytics experience
-- from none to expert -- demonstrates the system's usability and reveals
distinct user behavior patterns. The findings identify design implications for
human-agent collaboration, validate the practical utility of VIDEE for
non-expert users, and inform future improvements to intelligent text analytics

these issues, we propose TBDetector, a transformer-based advanced persistent

graphs provide rich historical information and have the powerful attacks
historic correlation ability to identify anomalous activities, TBDetector
employs provenance analysis for APT detection, which summarizes long-running
system execution with space efficiency and utilizes transformer with
self-attention based encoder-decoder to extract long-term contextual features
of system states to detect slow-acting attacks. Furthermore, we further
introduce anomaly scores to investigate the anomaly of different system states,
where each state is calculated with an anomaly score corresponding to its
similarity score and isolation score. To evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed method, we have conducted experiments on five public datasets, i.e.,
streamspot, cadets, shellshock, clearscope, and wget_baseline. Experimental
results and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods have exhibited better
performance of our proposed method.

                                        <span>  Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) are
emerging as a powerful paradigm for solving complex, multifaceted problems.
However, the potential of these systems is often constrained by the prevalent
plan-and-execute framework, which suffers from critical limitations: rigid plan
execution, static agent capabilities, and inefficient communication. These
weaknesses hinder their adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments.
This paper introduces Aime, a novel multi-agent framework designed to overcome
these challenges through dynamic, reactive planning and execution. Aime
replaces the conventional static workflow with a fluid and adaptive
architecture. Its core innovations include: (1) a Dynamic Planner that
continuously refines the overall strategy based on real-time execution
feedback; (2) an Actor Factory that implements Dynamic Actor instantiation,
assembling specialized agents on-demand with tailored tools and knowledge; and
(3) a centralized Progress Management Module that serves as a single source of
truth for coherent, system-wide state awareness. We empirically evaluated Aime
on a diverse suite of benchmarks spanning general reasoning (GAIA), software
engineering (SWE-bench Verified), and live web navigation (WebVoyager). The
results demonstrate that Aime consistently outperforms even highly specialized
state-of-the-art agents in their respective domains. Its superior adaptability
and task success rate establish Aime as a more resilient and effective
foundation for multi-agent collaboration.

of misinformation and identity impersonation. While various datasets for
synthetic speech analysis have been developed, they often focus on specific
areas, limiting their utility for comprehensive research. To fill this gap, we
propose the Speech-Forensics dataset by extensively covering authentic,
synthetic, and partially forged speech samples that include multiple segments
synthesized by different high-quality algorithms. Moreover, we propose a
TEmporal Speech LocalizaTion network, called TEST, aiming at simultaneously
performing authenticity detection, multiple fake segments localization, and
synthesis algorithms recognition, without any complex post-processing. TEST
effectively integrates LSTM and Transformer to extract more powerful temporal
speech representations and utilizes dense prediction on multi-scale pyramid
features to estimate the synthetic spans. Our model achieves an average mAP of
83.55% and an EER of 5.25% at the utterance level. At the segment level, it
attains an EER of 1.07% and a 92.19% F1 score. These results highlight the
model's robust capability for a comprehensive analysis of synthetic speech,
offering a promising avenue for future research and practical applications in
this field.

                                        <span>  Human mobility modeling is critical for urban planning and transportation
management, yet existing approaches often lack the integration capabilities
needed to handle diverse data sources. We present a foundation model framework
for universal human mobility patterns that leverages cross-domain data fusion
and large language models to address these limitations. Our approach integrates
multi-modal data of distinct nature and spatio-temporal resolution, including
geographical, mobility, socio-demographic, and traffic information, to
construct a privacy-preserving and semantically enriched human travel
trajectory dataset. Our framework demonstrates adaptability through domain
transfer techniques that ensure transferability across diverse urban contexts,
as evidenced in case studies of Los Angeles (LA) and Egypt. The framework
employs LLMs for semantic enrichment of trajectory data, enabling comprehensive
understanding of mobility patterns. Quantitative evaluation shows that our
generated synthetic dataset accurately reproduces mobility patterns observed in
empirical data. The practical utility of this foundation model approach is
demonstrated through large-scale traffic simulations for LA County, where
results align well with observed traffic data. On California's I-405 corridor,
the simulation yields a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 5.85% for traffic
volume and 4.36% for speed compared to Caltrans PeMS observations, illustrating
the framework's potential for intelligent transportation systems and urban
mobility applications.

                                        <span>  Modern web agents possess computer use abilities that allow them to interact
with webpages by sending commands to a virtual keyboard and mouse. While such
agents have considerable potential to assist human users with complex tasks,
evaluating their capabilities in real-world settings poses a major challenge.
To this end, we introduce BEARCUBS, a "small but mighty" benchmark of 111
information-seeking questions designed to evaluate a web agent's ability to
search, browse, and identify factual information from the web. Unlike prior web
agent benchmarks, solving BEARCUBS requires (1) accessing live web content
rather than synthetic or simulated pages, which captures the unpredictability
of real-world web interactions; and (2) performing a broad range of multimodal
interactions (e.g., video understanding, 3D navigation) that cannot be bypassed
via text-based workarounds. Each question in BEARCUBS has a corresponding
short, unambiguous answer and a human-validated browsing trajectory, allowing
for transparent evaluation of agent performance and strategies. A human study
confirms that BEARCUBS questions are solvable but non-trivial (84.7% human
accuracy), revealing domain knowledge gaps and overlooked details as common
failure points. By contrast, state-of-the-art computer-using agents
underperform, with the best-scoring system (OpenAI's Operator) reaching only
23.4% accuracy. These results highlight critical areas for improvement,
including reliable source selection and more powerful multimodal capabilities.
To facilitate future research, BEARCUBS will be updated periodically to replace
invalid or contaminated questions, keeping the benchmark fresh for future
generations of web agents.

software development, yet most benchmarks focus narrowly on code generation
tasks. Recent efforts like InfiBench and StackEval attempt to address this gap
using Stack Overflow data but remain limited to single-turn interactions in
isolated contexts, require significant manual curation, and fail to represent
complete project environments. We introduce CodeAssistBench (CAB), the first
benchmark framework for evaluating multi-turn programming assistance in
realistic settings that address real-world questions about actual codebases.
Unlike existing programming Q&A benchmarks, CAB automatically generates
scalable datasets from question-related GitHub issues using configurable
parameters (e.g., repository creation date, star count, programming languages),
and includes automatic containerization of codebases for evaluation. It then
evaluates models through simulated users in these containerized environments
with full codebase access. Using this framework, we constructed a test set of
3,286 real-world programming questions across 231 repositories, spanning seven
programming languages and diverse problem domains. Our evaluation of leading
LLMs reveals a substantial capability gap: while models perform well on Stack
Overflow questions with success rates of 70-83%, they resolve only up to 16.49%
of CAB's recent issues. This discrepancy highlights the challenges of providing
assistance in complex, project-specific contexts versus answering standalone
questions.

                                        <span>  Graph pooling, which compresses a whole graph into a smaller coarsened graph,
is an essential component of graph representation learning. To efficiently
compress a given graph, graph pooling methods often drop their nodes with
attention-based scoring with the task loss. However, this often results in
simply removing nodes with lower degrees without consideration of their
feature-level relevance to the given task. To fix this problem, we propose a
Multi-View Pruning(MVP), a graph pruning method based on a multi-view framework
and reconstruction loss. Given a graph, MVP first constructs multiple graphs
for different views either by utilizing the predefined modalities or by
randomly partitioning the input features, to consider the importance of each
node in diverse perspectives. Then, it learns the score for each node by
considering both the reconstruction and the task loss. MVP can be incorporated
with any hierarchical pooling framework to score the nodes. We validate MVP on
multiple benchmark datasets by coupling it with two graph pooling methods, and
show that it significantly improves the performance of the base graph pooling
method, outperforming all baselines. Further analysis shows that both the
encoding of multiple views and the consideration of reconstruction loss are the
key to the success of MVP, and that it indeed identifies nodes that are less
important according to domain knowledge.

                                        <span>  The increasing use of generative AI for resume screening is predicated on the
assumption that it offers an unbiased alternative to biased human
decision-making. However, this belief fails to address a critical question: are
these AI systems fundamentally competent at the evaluative tasks they are meant
to perform?
  This study investigates the question of competence through a two-part audit
of eight major AI platforms. Experiment 1 confirmed complex, contextual racial
and gender biases, with some models penalizing candidates merely for the
presence of demographic signals. Experiment 2, which evaluated core competence,
provided a critical insight: some models that appeared unbiased were, in fact,
incapable of performing a substantive evaluation, relying instead on
superficial keyword matching.
  This paper introduces the "Illusion of Neutrality" to describe this
phenomenon, where an apparent lack of bias is merely a symptom of a model's
inability to make meaningful judgments. This study recommends that
organizations and regulators adopt a dual-validation framework, auditing AI
hiring tools for both demographic bias and demonstrable competence to ensure
they are both equitable and effective.

containing even a small fraction of poisoned data. We demonstrate that GPT
models remain vulnerable to fine-tuning on poisoned data, even when safeguarded
by moderation systems. Given the persistence of data poisoning vulnerabilities
in today's most capable models, this paper investigates whether these risks
increase with model scaling. We evaluate three threat models -- malicious
fine-tuning, imperfect data curation, and intentional data contamination --
across 24 frontier LLMs ranging from 1.5 to 72 billion parameters. Our
experiments reveal that larger LLMs are significantly more susceptible to data
poisoning, learning harmful behaviors from even minimal exposure to harmful
data more quickly than smaller models. These findings underscore the need for
leading AI companies to thoroughly red team fine-tuning APIs before public
release and to develop more robust safeguards against data poisoning,
particularly as models continue to scale in size and capability.

diversity of agent environments and the complexity of noisy agentic data.
Existing infrastructure offers limited support for scalable, agent-specific

a lightweight and extensible data and training framework designed for large
action models. ActionStudio unifies diverse agent trajectories using our
proposed Unified Format 2.0, supports a range of training workflows with
optimized multi-node distributed setup, and integrates robust preprocessing and
real-time verification tools. ActionStudio demonstrates up to 9x higher
throughput compared to existing agentic training frameworks, and our trained

in unseen domains without additional training or fine-tuning, addressing the
limitations of traditional models in sparse data environments. Recent
advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced ZCDSR
by facilitating cross-domain knowledge transfer through rich, pretrained
representations. Despite this progress, domain semantic bias -- arising from
differences in vocabulary and content focus between domains -- remains a
persistent challenge, leading to misaligned item embeddings and reduced
generalization across domains. To address this, we propose a novel semantic
bias-aware framework that enhances LLM-based ZCDSR by improving cross-domain
alignment at both the item and sequential levels. At the item level, we
introduce a generalization loss that aligns the embeddings of items across
domains (inter-domain compactness), while preserving the unique characteristics
of each item within its own domain (intra-domain diversity). This ensures that
item embeddings can be transferred effectively between domains without
collapsing into overly generic or uniform representations. At the sequential
level, we develop a method to transfer user behavioral patterns by clustering
source domain user sequences and applying attention-based aggregation during
target domain inference. We dynamically adapt user embeddings to unseen
domains, enabling effective zero-shot recommendations without requiring
target-domain interactions...

physical world through creativity, planning, and foresight. As such, these
capabilities are often regarded as measurable indicators of intelligence across
biological species. While much of today's research on robotic intelligence
focuses on generating better controllers, inventing smarter tools offers a
complementary form of physical intelligence: shifting the onus of
problem-solving onto the tool's design. Given the vast and impressive
common-sense, reasoning, and creative capabilities of today's foundation
models, we investigate whether these models can provide useful priors to
automatically design and effectively wield such tools? We present VLMgineer, a
framework that harnesses the code generation abilities of vision language
models (VLMs) together with evolutionary search to iteratively co-design
physical tools and the action plans that operate them to perform a task. We
evaluate VLMgineer on a diverse new benchmark of everyday manipulation
scenarios that demand creative tool design and use. Across this suite,
VLMgineer consistently discovers tools and policies that solve tasks more
effectively and innovatively, transforming challenging robotics problems into
straightforward executions. It also outperforms VLM-generated designs from
human specifications and existing human-crafted tools for everyday tasks. To
facilitate future research on automated tool invention, we will release our

                                        <span>  Accurate modeling and control of autonomous vehicles remain a fundamental
challenge due to the nonlinear and coupled nature of vehicle dynamics. While
Koopman operator theory offers a framework for deploying powerful linear
control techniques, learning a finite-dimensional invariant subspace for
high-fidelity modeling continues to be an open problem. This paper presents a
deep Koopman approach for modeling and control of vehicle dynamics within the
curvilinear Frenet frame. The proposed framework uses a deep neural network
architecture to simultaneously learn the Koopman operator and its associated
invariant subspace from the data. Input-state bilinear interactions are
captured by the algorithm while preserving convexity, which makes it suitable
for real-time model predictive control (MPC) application. A multi-step
prediction loss is utilized during training to ensure long-horizon prediction
capability. To further enhance real-time trajectory tracking performance, the
model is integrated with a cumulative error regulator (CER) module, which
compensates for model mismatch by mitigating accumulated prediction errors.
Closed-loop performance is evaluated through hardware-in-the-loop (HIL)
experiments using a CarSim RT model as the target plant, with real-time
validation conducted on a dSPACE SCALEXIO system. The proposed controller
achieved significant reductions in tracking error relative to baseline
controllers, confirming its suitability for real-time implementation in
embedded autonomous vehicle systems.

                                        <span>  Spatial reasoning in 3D space is central to human cognition and indispensable
for embodied tasks such as navigation and manipulation. However,
state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) struggle frequently with tasks
as simple as anticipating how a scene will look after an egocentric motion:
they perceive 2D images but lack an internal model of 3D dynamics. We therefore
propose MindJourney, a test-time scaling framework that grants a VLM with this
missing capability by coupling it to a controllable world model based on video
diffusion. The VLM iteratively sketches a concise camera trajectory, while the
world model synthesizes the corresponding view at each step. The VLM then
reasons over this multi-view evidence gathered during the interactive
exploration. Without any fine-tuning, our MindJourney achieves over an average
8% performance boost on the representative spatial reasoning benchmark SAT,
showing that pairing VLMs with world models for test-time scaling offers a
simple, plug-and-play route to robust 3D reasoning. Meanwhile, our method also
improves upon the test-time inference VLMs trained through reinforcement
learning, which demonstrates the potential of our method that utilizes world
models for test-time scaling.

cell developed to automate the measurement of surface wettability on 3D-printed
materials. Designed for precision, repeatability, and safety, ACAT addresses
the limitations of manual contact angle testing by combining programmable
robotics, precise liquid dispensing, and a modular software-hardware
architecture. The system is composed of three core subsystems: (1) an
electrical system including power, control, and safety circuits compliant with
industrial standards such as NEC 70, NFPA 79, and UL 508A; (2) a software
control system based on a Raspberry Pi and Python, featuring fault detection,
GPIO logic, and operator interfaces; and (3) a mechanical system that includes
a 3-axis Cartesian robot, pneumatic actuation, and a precision liquid dispenser
enclosed within a safety-certified frame. The ACAT enables high-throughput,
automated surface characterization and provides a robust platform for future
integration into smart manufacturing and materials discovery workflows. This
paper details the design methodology, implementation strategies, and system
integration required to develop the ACAT platform.

                                        <span>  Training of autonomous driving systems requires extensive datasets with
precise annotations to attain robust performance. Human annotations suffer from
imperfections, and multiple iterations are often needed to produce high-quality
datasets. However, manually reviewing large datasets is laborious and
expensive. In this paper, we introduce AutoVDC (Automated Vision Data Cleaning)
framework and investigate the utilization of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to
automatically identify erroneous annotations in vision datasets, thereby
enabling users to eliminate these errors and enhance data quality. We validate
our approach using the KITTI and nuImages datasets, which contain object
detection benchmarks for autonomous driving. To test the effectiveness of
AutoVDC, we create dataset variants with intentionally injected erroneous
annotations and observe the error detection rate of our approach. Additionally,
we compare the detection rates using different VLMs and explore the impact of
VLM fine-tuning on our pipeline. The results demonstrate our method's high
performance in error detection and data cleaning experiments, indicating its
potential to significantly improve the reliability and accuracy of large-scale
production datasets in autonomous driving.

generating valid and optimal paths in 2D grid environments, simulating
simplified robotic planning, comparing text-only versus text-plus-visual inputs
across varying model sizes and grid complexities. Our results indicate moderate
success rates on simpler small grids, where visual input or few-shot text
prompting offered some benefits. However, performance significantly degraded on
larger grids, highlighting a scalability challenge. While larger models
generally achieved higher average success, the visual modality was not
universally dominant over well-structured text for these multimodal systems,
and successful paths on simpler grids were generally of high quality. These
results indicate current limitations in robust spatial reasoning, constraint

                                        <span>  Existing LGL methods typically consider only partial information (e.g.,
geometric features) from LiDAR observations or are designed for homogeneous
LiDAR sensors, overlooking the uniformity in LGL. In this work, a uniform LGL
method is proposed, termed UniLGL, which simultaneously achieves spatial and
material uniformity, as well as sensor-type uniformity. The key idea of the
proposed method is to encode the complete point cloud, which contains both
geometric and material information, into a pair of BEV images (i.e., a spatial
BEV image and an intensity BEV image). An end-to-end multi-BEV fusion network
is designed to extract uniform features, equipping UniLGL with spatial and
material uniformity. To ensure robust LGL across heterogeneous LiDAR sensors, a
viewpoint invariance hypothesis is introduced, which replaces the conventional
translation equivariance assumption commonly used in existing LPR networks and
supervises UniLGL to achieve sensor-type uniformity in both global descriptors
and local feature representations. Finally, based on the mapping between local
features on the 2D BEV image and the point cloud, a robust global pose
estimator is derived that determines the global minimum of the global pose on
SE(3) without requiring additional registration. To validate the effectiveness
of the proposed uniform LGL, extensive benchmarks are conducted in real-world
environments, and the results show that the proposed UniLGL is demonstratively
competitive compared to other State-of-the-Art LGL methods. Furthermore, UniLGL
has been deployed on diverse platforms, including full-size trucks and agile
Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), to enable high-precision localization and mapping
as well as multi-MAV collaborative exploration in port and forest environments,
demonstrating the applicability of UniLGL in industrial and field scenarios.

                                        <span>  Trajectory planning involving multi-agent interactions has been a
long-standing challenge in the field of robotics, primarily burdened by the
inherent yet intricate interactions among agents. While game-theoretic methods
are widely acknowledged for their effectiveness in managing multi-agent
interactions, significant impediments persist when it comes to accommodating
the intentional uncertainties of agents. In the context of intentional
uncertainties, the heavy computational burdens associated with existing
game-theoretic methods are induced, leading to inefficiencies and poor
scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel game-theoretic interactive
trajectory planning method to effectively address the intentional uncertainties
of agents, and it demonstrates both high efficiency and enhanced scalability.
As the underpinning basis, we model the interactions between agents under
intentional uncertainties as a general Bayesian game, and we show that its
agent-form equivalence can be represented as a potential game under certain
minor assumptions. The existence and attainability of the optimal interactive
trajectories are illustrated, as the corresponding Bayesian Nash equilibrium
can be attained by optimizing a unified optimization problem. Additionally, we
present a distributed algorithm based on the dual consensus alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM) tailored to the parallel solving of the
problem, thereby significantly improving the scalability. The attendant
outcomes from simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
is effective across a range of scenarios characterized by general forms of
intentional uncertainties. Its scalability surpasses that of existing
centralized and decentralized baselines, allowing for real-time interactive
trajectory planning in uncertain game settings.

safety-critical environments, ensuring their safe operation under diverse
conditions is paramount. This paper presents a novel approach for their safety
verification based on systematic situation extraction, probabilistic modelling
and verification. We build upon the concept of a situation coverage grid, which
exhaustively enumerates environmental configurations relevant to the vehicle's
operation. This grid is augmented with quantitative probabilistic data
collected from situation-based system testing, capturing probabilistic
transitions between situations. We then generate a probabilistic model that
encodes the dynamics of both normal and unsafe system behaviour. Safety
properties extracted from hazard analysis and formalised in temporal logic are
verified through probabilistic model checking against this model. The results
demonstrate that our approach effectively identifies high-risk situations,
provides quantitative safety guarantees, and supports compliance with
regulatory standards, thereby contributing to the robust deployment of
autonomous systems.

                                        <span>  Walkability is a key component of sustainable urban development, while
collecting detailed data on its related features remains challenging due to the
high costs and limited scalability of traditional methods. Sidewalk delivery
robots, increasingly deployed in urban environments, offer a promising solution
to these limitations. This paper explores how these robots can serve as mobile
data collection platforms, capturing sidewalk-level features related to
walkability in a scalable, automated, and real-time manner. A sensor-equipped
robot was deployed on a sidewalk network at KTH in Stockholm, completing 101
trips covering 900 segments. From the collected data, different typologies of
features are derived, including robot trip characteristics (e.g., speed,
duration), sidewalk conditions (e.g., width, surface unevenness), and sidewalk
utilization (e.g., pedestrian density). Their walkability-related implications
were investigated with a series of analyses. The results demonstrate that
pedestrian movement patterns are strongly influenced by sidewalk
characteristics, with higher density, reduced width, and surface irregularity
associated with slower and more variable trajectories. Notably, robot speed
closely mirrors pedestrian behavior, highlighting its potential as a proxy for
assessing pedestrian dynamics. The proposed framework enables continuous
monitoring of sidewalk conditions and pedestrian behavior, contributing to the
development of more walkable, inclusive, and responsive urban environments.

agriculture in orchards, as it allows autonomous robots to perform tasks like
targeted operations or individual tree monitoring. However, creating these maps
is challenging because GPS signals are often unreliable under dense tree
canopies. Furthermore, standard Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
approaches struggle in orchards because the repetitive appearance of trees can
confuse the system, leading to mapping errors. To address this, we introduce
Tree-SLAM, a semantic SLAM approach tailored for creating maps of individual
trees in orchards. Utilizing RGB-D images, our method detects tree trunks with
an instance segmentation model, estimates their location and re-identifies them
using a cascade-graph-based data association algorithm. These re-identified
trunks serve as landmarks in a factor graph framework that integrates noisy GPS
signals, odometry, and trunk observations. The system produces maps of
individual trees with a geo-localization error as low as 18 cm, which is less
than 20\% of the planting distance. The proposed method was validated on
diverse datasets from apple and pear orchards across different seasons,
demonstrating high mapping accuracy and robustness in scenarios with unreliable
GPS signals.

challenge and a critical necessity for ensuring safety in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast to most existing data-driven approaches that directly
predict future trajectories, we rethink this task from a planning perspective,
advocating a "First Reasoning, Then Forecasting" strategy that explicitly
incorporates behavior intentions as spatial guidance for trajectory prediction.
To achieve this, we introduce an interpretable, reward-driven intention
reasoner grounded in a novel query-centric Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)
scheme. Our method first encodes traffic agents and scene elements into a
unified vectorized representation, then aggregates contextual features through
a query-centric paradigm. This enables the derivation of a reward distribution,
a compact yet informative representation of the target agent's behavior within
the given scene context via IRL. Guided by this reward heuristic, we perform
policy rollouts to reason about multiple plausible intentions, providing
valuable priors for subsequent trajectory generation. Finally, we develop a
hierarchical DETR-like decoder integrated with bidirectional selective state
space models to produce accurate future trajectories along with their
associated probabilities. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse
and nuScenes motion forecasting datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly enhances trajectory prediction confidence, achieving highly
competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art methods.

distribution, reducing congestion compared to trucks and providing a safer,
higher-capacity alternative to drones. However, unreliable travel times on
sidewalks due to pedestrian density, obstacles, and varying infrastructure
conditions can significantly affect their efficiency. This study addresses the
robust route planning problem for sidewalk robots, explicitly accounting for
travel time uncertainty due to varying sidewalk conditions. Optimization is
integrated with simulation to reproduce the effect of obstacles and pedestrian
flows and generate realistic travel times. The study investigates three
different approaches to derive uncertainty sets, including budgeted,
ellipsoidal, and support vector clustering (SVC)-based methods, along with a
distributionally robust method to solve the shortest path (SP) problem. A
realistic case study reproducing pedestrian patterns in Stockholm's city center
is used to evaluate the efficiency of robust routing across various robot
designs and environmental conditions. The results show that, when compared to a
conventional SP, robust routing significantly enhances operational reliability
under variable sidewalk conditions. The Ellipsoidal and DRSP approaches
outperform the other methods, yielding the most efficient paths in terms of
average and worst-case delay. Sensitivity analyses reveal that robust
approaches consistently outperform the conventional SP, particularly for
sidewalk delivery robots that are wider, slower, and have more conservative
navigation behaviors. These benefits are even more pronounced in adverse
weather conditions and high pedestrian congestion scenarios.

                                        <span>  We propose SGLoc, a novel localization system that directly regresses camera
poses from 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation by leveraging semantic
information. Our method utilizes the semantic relationship between 2D image and
3D scene representation to estimate the 6DoF pose without prior pose
information. In this system, we introduce a multi-level pose regression
strategy that progressively estimates and refines the pose of query image from
the global 3DGS map, without requiring initial pose priors. Moreover, we
introduce a semantic-based global retrieval algorithm that establishes
correspondences between 2D (image) and 3D (3DGS map). By matching the extracted
scene semantic descriptors of 2D query image and 3DGS semantic representation,
we align the image with the local region of the global 3DGS map, thereby
obtaining a coarse pose estimation. Subsequently, we refine the coarse pose by
iteratively optimizing the difference between the query image and the rendered
image from 3DGS. Our SGLoc demonstrates superior performance over baselines on
12scenes and 7scenes datasets, showing excellent capabilities in global
localization without initial pose prior. Code will be available at

collisions. This study leverages deep generative models to enhance the safety
of autonomous vehicles in an intersection context. We train a 1000-step
denoising diffusion probabilistic model to generate collision-causing sensor
noise sequences for an autonomous vehicle navigating a four-way intersection
based on the current relative position and velocity of an intruder. Using the
generative adversarial architecture, the 1000-step model is distilled into a
single-step denoising diffusion model which demonstrates fast inference speed
while maintaining similar sampling quality. We demonstrate one possible
application of the single-step model in building a robust planner for the
autonomous vehicle. The planner uses the single-step model to efficiently
sample potential failure cases based on the currently measured traffic state to
inform its decision-making. Through simulation experiments, the robust planner
demonstrates significantly lower failure rate and delay rate compared with the
baseline Intelligent Driver Model controller.

                                        <span>  Scaling deep neural networks (NN) of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms
has been shown to enhance performance when feature extraction networks are used
but the gained performance comes at the significant expense of increased
computational and memory complexity. Neural network pruning methods have
successfully addressed this challenge in supervised learning. However, their
application to RL is underexplored. We propose an approach to integrate
simultaneous training and pruning within advanced RL methods, in particular to
RL algorithms enhanced by the Online Feature Extractor Network (OFENet). Our
networks (XiNet) are trained to solve stochastic optimization problems over the
RL networks' weights and the parameters of variational Bernoulli distributions
for 0/1 Random Variables $\xi$ scaling each unit in the networks. The
stochastic problem formulation induces regularization terms that promote
convergence of the variational parameters to 0 when a unit contributes little
to the performance. In this case, the corresponding structure is rendered
permanently inactive and pruned from its network. We propose a cost-aware,
sparsity-promoting regularization scheme, tailored to the DenseNet architecture
of OFENets expressing the parameter complexity of involved networks in terms of
the parameters of the RVs in these networks. Then, when matching this cost with
the regularization terms, the many hyperparameters associated with them are
automatically selected, effectively combining the RL objectives and network
compression. We evaluate our method on continuous control benchmarks (MuJoCo)
and the Soft Actor-Critic RL agent, demonstrating that OFENets can be pruned
considerably with minimal loss in performance. Furthermore, our results confirm
that pruning large networks during training produces more efficient and higher
performing RL agents rather than training smaller networks from scratch.

multimodal data, including text, images, audio, and simulation outputs for
smarter, more adaptive decision-making. As the aquaculture industry shifts
toward data-driven, automation and digital integration operations under the
Aquaculture 4.0 paradigm, GAI models offer novel opportunities across
environmental monitoring, robotics, disease diagnostics, infrastructure
planning, reporting, and market analysis. This review presents the first
comprehensive synthesis of GAI applications in aquaculture, encompassing
foundational architectures (e.g., diffusion models, transformers, and retrieval
augmented generation), experimental systems, pilot deployments, and real-world
use cases. We highlight GAI's growing role in enabling underwater perception,
digital twin modeling, and autonomous planning for remotely operated vehicle
(ROV) missions. We also provide an updated application taxonomy that spans
sensing, control, optimization, communication, and regulatory compliance.
Beyond technical capabilities, we analyze key limitations, including limited
data availability, real-time performance constraints, trust and explainability,
environmental costs, and regulatory uncertainty. This review positions GAI not
merely as a tool but as a critical enabler of smart, resilient, and
environmentally aligned aquaculture systems.

auditory stimuli remains a key challenge in character animation, demanding the
integration of perceptual modeling and motion synthesis. Despite its
significance, this task remains largely unexplored. Most previous works have
primarily focused on mapping modalities like speech, audio, and music to
generate human motion. As of yet, these models typically overlook the impact of
spatial features encoded in spatial audio signals on human motion. To bridge
this gap and enable high-quality modeling of human movements in response to
spatial audio, we introduce the first comprehensive Spatial Audio-Driven Human
Motion (SAM) dataset, which contains diverse and high-quality spatial audio and
motion data. For benchmarking, we develop a simple yet effective
diffusion-based generative framework for human MOtion generation driven by
SPatial Audio, termed MOSPA, which faithfully captures the relationship between
body motion and spatial audio through an effective fusion mechanism. Once
trained, MOSPA could generate diverse realistic human motions conditioned on
varying spatial audio inputs. We perform a thorough investigation of the
proposed dataset and conduct extensive experiments for benchmarking, where our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on this task. Our model and
dataset will be open-sourced upon acceptance. Please refer to our supplementary

                                        <span>  Motion planning for autonomous vehicles (AVs) in dense traffic is
challenging, often leading to overly conservative behavior and unmet planning
objectives. This challenge stems from the AVs' limited ability to anticipate
and respond to the interactive behavior of surrounding agents. Traditional
decoupled prediction and planning pipelines rely on non-interactive predictions
that overlook the fact that agents often adapt their behavior in response to
the AV's actions. To address this, we propose Interaction-Aware Neural
Network-Enhanced Model Predictive Path Integral (IANN-MPPI) control, which
enables interactive trajectory planning by predicting how surrounding agents
may react to each control sequence sampled by MPPI. To improve performance in
structured lane environments, we introduce a spline-based prior for the MPPI
sampling distribution, enabling efficient lane-changing behavior. We evaluate
IANN-MPPI in a dense traffic merging scenario, demonstrating its ability to
perform efficient merging maneuvers. Our project website is available at

                                        <span>  Grasping unknown objects from a single view has remained a challenging topic
in robotics due to the uncertainty of partial observation. Recent advances in
large-scale models have led to benchmark solutions such as GraspNet-1Billion.
However, such learning-based approaches still face a critical limitation in
performance robustness for their sensitivity to sensing noise and environmental
changes. To address this bottleneck in achieving highly generalized grasping,
we abandon the traditional learning framework and introduce a new perspective:
similarity matching, where similar known objects are utilized to guide the
grasping of unknown target objects. We newly propose a method that robustly
achieves unknown-object grasping from a single viewpoint through three key
steps: 1) Leverage the visual features of the observed object to perform
similarity matching with an existing database containing various object models,
identifying potential candidates with high similarity; 2) Use the candidate
models with pre-existing grasping knowledge to plan imitative grasps for the
unknown target object; 3) Optimize the grasp quality through a local
fine-tuning process. To address the uncertainty caused by partial and noisy
observation, we propose a multi-level similarity matching framework that
integrates semantic, geometric, and dimensional features for comprehensive
evaluation. Especially, we introduce a novel point cloud geometric descriptor,
the C-FPFH descriptor, which facilitates accurate similarity assessment between
partial point clouds of observed objects and complete point clouds of database
models. In addition, we incorporate the use of large language models, introduce
the semi-oriented bounding box, and develop a novel point cloud registration
approach based on plane detection to enhance matching accuracy under
single-view conditions. Videos are available at https://youtu.be/qQDIELMhQmk.

                                        <span>  Real-time path planning in dense, uncertain environments remains a
challenging problem, as predicting the future motions of numerous dynamic
obstacles is computationally burdensome and unrealistic. To address this, we
introduce Hybrid Prediction-based Risk-Aware Planning (HyPRAP), a
prediction-based risk-aware path-planning framework which uses a hybrid
combination of models to predict local obstacle movement. HyPRAP uses a novel
Prediction-based Collision Risk Index (P-CRI) to evaluate the risk posed by
each obstacle, enabling the selective use of predictors based on whether the
agent prioritizes high predictive accuracy or low computational prediction
overhead. This selective routing enables the agent to focus on high-risk
obstacles while ignoring or simplifying low-risk ones, making it suitable for
environments with a large number of obstacles. Moreover, HyPRAP incorporates
uncertainty quantification through hybrid conformal prediction by deriving
confidence bounds simultaneously achieved by multiple predictions across
different models. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that HyPRAP effectively
balances safety and computational efficiency by leveraging the diversity of
prediction models. Extensive simulations validate these insights for more
general settings, confirming that HyPRAP performs better compared to single
predictor methods, and P-CRI performs better over naive proximity-based risk
assessment.

for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) operating in GPS-denied,
communication-limited marine environments. However, most current AUV platforms
execute static, pre-programmed missions or rely on tethered connections and
high-latency acoustic channels for mid-mission updates, significantly limiting
their adaptability and responsiveness. In this paper, we introduce NemeSys, a
novel AUV system designed to support real-time mission reconfiguration through
compact optical and magnetoelectric (OME) signaling facilitated by floating
buoys. We present the full system design, control architecture, and a semantic
mission encoding framework that enables interactive exploration and task
adaptation via low-bandwidth communication. The proposed system is validated
through analytical modeling, controlled experimental evaluations, and
open-water trials. Results confirm the feasibility of online mission adaptation
and semantic task updates, highlighting NemeSys as an online AUV platform for
goal-driven adaptive autonomy in dynamic and uncertain underwater environments.

                                        <span>  Tethered robots play a pivotal role in specialized environments such as
disaster response and underground exploration, where their stable power supply
and reliable communication offer unparalleled advantages. However, their motion
planning is severely constrained by tether length limitations and entanglement
risks, posing significant challenges to achieving optimal path planning. To
address these challenges, this study introduces CDT-TCS (Convex Dissection
Topology-based Tethered Configuration Search), a novel algorithm that leverages
CDT Encoding as a homotopy invariant to represent topological states of paths.
By integrating algebraic topology with geometric optimization, CDT-TCS
efficiently computes the complete set of optimal feasible configurations for
tethered robots at all positions in 2D environments through a single
computation. Building on this foundation, we further propose three
application-specific algorithms: i) CDT-TPP for optimal tethered path planning,
ii) CDT-TMV for multi-goal visiting with tether constraints, iii) CDT-UTPP for
distance-optimal path planning of untethered robots. All theoretical results
and propositions underlying these algorithms are rigorously proven and
thoroughly discussed in this paper. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the
proposed algorithms significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in their
respective problem domains. Furthermore, real-world experiments on robotic
platforms validate the practicality and engineering value of the proposed
framework.

review analyses the gaps of AR from the perspective of AD to highlight
promising research directions, such as multimodal sensor techniques for
lightweight platforms and edge deep learning architectures. By synthesising

perception, prediction, and planning within a single framework, reducing
information loss and improving adaptability. However, existing methods often
rely on fixed and sparse trajectory supervision, limiting their ability to
capture the hierarchical reasoning process that human drivers naturally employ.
To bridge this gap, we propose ReAL-AD, a Reasoning-Augmented Learning
framework that structures decision-making in autonomous driving based on the
three-tier human cognitive model: Driving Strategy, Driving Decision, and
Driving Operation, where Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are incorporated to
enhance situational awareness and structured reasoning across these levels.
Specifically, we introduce: (1) the Strategic Reasoning Injector, which
formulates high-level driving strategies by interpreting complex traffic
contexts from VLM-generated insights; (2) the Tactical Reasoning Integrator,
which refines strategic intent into interpretable tactical choices such as lane
changes, overtaking, and speed adjustments; and (3) the Hierarchical Trajectory
Decoder, which progressively translates tactical decisions into precise control
actions for smooth and human-like trajectory execution. Extensive evaluations
show that integrating our framework improves planning accuracy and safety by
over 30%, making end-to-end autonomous driving more interpretable and aligned
with human-like hierarchical reasoning. The project page can be found at:

and a pivotal challenge in robotics. The development of Artificial Intelligence
(AI) has allowed rapid progress in robotic manipulation. This survey summarizes
the evolution of robotic manipulation from mechanical programming to embodied
intelligence, alongside the transition from simple grippers to multi-fingered
dexterous hands, outlining key characteristics and main challenges. Focusing on
the current stage of embodied dexterous manipulation, we highlight recent
advances in two critical areas: dexterous manipulation data collection (via
simulation, human demonstrations, and teleoperation) and skill-learning
frameworks (imitation and reinforcement learning). Then, based on the overview
of the existing data collection paradigm and learning framework, three key
challenges restricting the development of dexterous robotic manipulation are
summarized and discussed.

tasks. The results also highlight the proposed framework's ability to handle
large robot populations and adapt to scenarios with diverse task sets.

                                        <span>  We propose an object-centric recovery (OCR) framework to address the
challenges of out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios in visuomotor policy
learning. Previous behavior cloning (BC) methods rely heavily on a large amount
of labeled data coverage, failing in unfamiliar spatial states. Without relying
on extra data collection, our approach learns a recovery policy constructed by
an inverse policy inferred from the object keypoint manifold gradient in the
original training data. The recovery policy serves as a simple add-on to any
base visuomotor BC policy, agnostic to a specific method, guiding the system
back towards the training distribution to ensure task success even in OOD
situations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our object-centric framework in
both simulation and real robot experiments, achieving an improvement of 77.7\%
over the base policy in OOD. Furthermore, we show OCR's capacity to
autonomously collect demonstrations for continual learning. Overall, we believe
this framework represents a step toward improving the robustness of visuomotor
policies in real-world settings.

                                        <span>  In-hand manipulation is a crucial ability for reorienting and repositioning
objects within grasps. The main challenges in this are not only the complexity
of the computational models, but also the risks of grasp instability caused by
active finger motions, such as rolling, sliding, breaking, and remaking
contacts. This paper presents the development of the Roller Ring (RR), a
modular robotic attachment with active surfaces that is wearable by both robot
and human hands to manipulate without lifting a finger. By installing the
angled RRs on hands, such that their spatial motions are not colinear, we
derive a general differential motion model for manipulating objects. Our motion
model shows that complete in-hand manipulation skill sets can be provided by as
few as only 2 RRs through non-holonomic object motions, while more RRs can
enable enhanced manipulation dexterity with fewer motion constraints. Through
extensive experiments, we test the RRs on both a robot hand and a human hand to
evaluate their manipulation capabilities. We show that the RRs can be employed
to manipulate arbitrary object shapes to provide dexterous in-hand
manipulation.

                                        <span>  Optimization has been widely used to generate smooth trajectories for motion
planning. However, existing trajectory optimization methods show weakness when
dealing with large-scale long trajectories. Recent advances in parallel
computing have accelerated optimization in some fields, but how to efficiently
solve trajectory optimization via parallelism remains an open question. In this
paper, we propose a novel trajectory optimization framework based on the
Consensus Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (CADMM) algorithm, which
decomposes the trajectory into multiple segments and solves the subproblems in
parallel. The proposed framework reduces the time complexity to O(1) per
iteration to the number of segments, compared to O(N) of the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) approaches. Furthermore, we introduce a closed-form solution that
integrates convex linear and quadratic constraints to speed up the
optimization, and we also present numerical solutions for general inequality
constraints. A series of simulations and experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms the SOTA approach in terms of efficiency and smoothness.
Especially for a large-scale trajectory, with one hundred segments, achieving
over a tenfold speedup. To fully explore the potential of our algorithm on
modern parallel computing architectures, we deploy our framework on a GPU and
show high performance with thousands of segments.

adapt to new, unpredictable terrains that can change rapidly during operation.
In such scenarios, a critical challenge becomes estimating the robot's dynamics
on changing terrain in order to enable reliable, accurate navigation and
planning. We present a novel online adaptation approach for terrain-aware
dynamics modeling and planning using function encoders. Our approach
efficiently adapts to new terrains at runtime using limited online data without
retraining or fine-tuning. By learning a set of neural network basis functions
that span the robot dynamics on diverse terrains, we enable rapid online
adaptation to new, unseen terrains and environments as a simple least-squares
calculation. We demonstrate our approach for terrain adaptation in a
Unity-based robotics simulator and show that the downstream controller has
better empirical performance due to higher accuracy of the learned model. This
leads to fewer collisions with obstacles while navigating in cluttered
environments as compared to a neural ODE baseline.

                                        <span>  Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for cyber-physical vehicle systems
usually requires a significantly long training time due to their inherent
complexity. Furthermore, deploying the trained policies in the real world
demands a feature-rich environment along with multiple physical embodied
agents, which may not be feasible due to monetary, physical, energy, or safety
constraints. This work seeks to address these pain points by presenting a
mixed-reality (MR) digital twin (DT) framework capable of: (i) boosting
training speeds by selectively scaling parallelized simulation workloads
on-demand, and (ii) immersing the MARL policies across hybrid
simulation-to-reality (sim2real) experiments. The viability and performance of
the proposed framework are highlighted through two representative use cases,
which cover cooperative as well as competitive classes of MARL problems. We
study the effect of: (i) agent and environment parallelization on training
time, and (ii) systematic domain randomization on zero-shot sim2real transfer,
across both case studies. Results indicate up to 76.3% reduction in training
time with the proposed parallelization scheme and sim2real gap as low as 2.9%
using the proposed deployment method.

                                        <span>  Legged machines are becoming increasingly agile and adaptive but they have so
far lacked the morphological diversity of legged animals, which have been
rearranged and reshaped to fill millions of niches. Unlike their biological
counterparts, legged machines have largely converged over the past decade to
canonical quadrupedal and bipedal architectures that cannot be easily
reconfigured to meet new tasks or recover from injury. Here we introduce
autonomous modular legs: agile yet minimal, single-degree-of-freedom jointed
links that can learn complex dynamic behaviors and may be freely attached to
form legged metamachines at the meter scale. This enables rapid repair,
redesign, and recombination of highly-dynamic modular agents that move quickly
and acrobatically (non-quasistatically) through unstructured environments.
Because each module is itself a complete agent, legged metamachines are able to
sustain deep structural damage that would completely disable other legged
robots. We also show how to encode the vast space of possible body
configurations into a compact latent design genome that can be efficiently
explored, revealing a wide diversity of novel legged forms.

locomotion, yet their role in expressive domains such as music performance
remains largely unexplored. Musical tasks, like drumming, present unique
challenges, including split-second timing, rapid contacts, and multi-limb
coordination over performances lasting minutes. In this paper, we introduce
Robot Drummer, a humanoid capable of expressive, high-precision drumming across
a diverse repertoire of songs. We formulate humanoid drumming as sequential
fulfillment of timed contacts and transform drum scores into a Rhythmic Contact
Chain. To handle the long-horizon nature of musical performance, we decompose
each piece into fixed-length segments and train a single policy across all
segments in parallel using reinforcement learning. Through extensive
experiments on over thirty popular rock, metal, and jazz tracks, our results
demonstrate that Robot Drummer consistently achieves high F1 scores. The
learned behaviors exhibit emergent human-like drumming strategies, such as
cross-arm strikes, and adaptive stick assignments, demonstrating the potential
of reinforcement learning to bring humanoid robots into the domain of creative
musical performance. Project page: robotdrummer.github.io

essential for sustained survival and development. In contrast, robots today are
primarily monolithic machines with limited ability to self-repair, physically
develop, or incorporate material from their environments. While robot minds
rapidly evolve new behaviors through AI, their bodies remain closed systems,
unable to systematically integrate material to grow or heal. We argue that
open-ended physical adaptation is only possible when robots are designed using
a small repertoire of simple modules. This allows machines to mechanically
adapt by consuming parts from other machines or their surroundings and shed
broken components. We demonstrate this principle on a truss modular robot
platform. We show how robots can grow bigger, faster, and more capable by
consuming materials from their environment and other robots. We suggest that
machine metabolic processes like those demonstrated here will be an essential
part of any sustained future robot ecology.

Car-following model Enhanced by Reality, a cutting-edge deep learning
car-following model, that satisfies partial derivative constraints, designed to
predict Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) driving behavior while staying
theoretically feasible. Unlike conventional models, RACER effectively
integrates Rational Driving Constraints (RDCs), crucial tenets of actual
driving, resulting in strikingly accurate and realistic predictions. Against
established models like the Optimal Velocity Relative Velocity (OVRV), a
car-following Neural Network (NN), and a car-following Physics-Informed Neural
Network (PINN), RACER excels across key metrics, such as acceleration,
velocity, and spacing. Notably, it displays a perfect adherence to the RDCs,
registering zero violations, in stark contrast to other models. This study
highlights the immense value of incorporating physical constraints within AI
models, especially for augmenting safety measures in transportation. It also
paves the way for future research to test these models against human driving
data, with the potential to guide safer and more rational driving behavior. The
versatility of the proposed model, including its potential to incorporate
additional derivative constraints and broader architectural applications,
enhances its appeal and broadens its impact within the scientific community.

outdoor scenes is challenging due to the difficulty of generating fine-grained
details from white noise over a broad field of view. The latest works
addressing scene completion with diffusion models tackle this problem by
reformulating the original DDPM as a local diffusion process. It contrasts with
the common practice of operating at the level of objects, where vanilla DDPMs
are currently used. In this work, we close the gap between these two lines of
work. We identify approximations in the local diffusion formulation, show that
they are not required to operate at the scene level, and that a vanilla DDPM
with a well-chosen starting point is enough for completion. Finally, we
demonstrate that our method, LiDPM, leads to better results in scene completion
on SemanticKITTI. The project page is https://astra-vision.github.io/LiDPM .

                                        <span>  Federated Learning (FL) is a promising machine learning paradigm that enables
participating devices to train privacy-preserved and collaborative models. FL
has proven its benefits for robotic manipulation tasks. However, grasping tasks
lack exploration in such settings where robots train a global model without
moving data and ensuring data privacy. The main challenge is that each robot
learns from data that is nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID)
and of low quantity. This exhibits performance degradation, particularly in
robotic grasping. Thus, in this work, we propose MTF-Grasp, a multi-tier FL
approach for robotic grasping, acknowledging the unique challenges posed by the
non-IID data distribution across robots, including quantitative skewness.
MTF-Grasp harnesses data quality and quantity across robots to select a set of
"top-level" robots with better data distribution and higher sample count. It
then utilizes top-level robots to train initial seed models and distribute them

degradation in low-level robots. Our approach outperforms the conventional FL

                                        <span>  Reinforcement learning (RL) faces challenges in trajectory planning for urban
automated driving due to the poor convergence of RL and the difficulty in
designing reward functions. Consequently, few RL-based trajectory planning
methods can achieve performance comparable to that of imitation learning-based
methods. The convergence problem is alleviated by combining RL with supervised
learning. However, most existing approaches only reason one step ahead and lack
the capability to plan for multiple future steps. Besides, although inverse
reinforcement learning holds promise for solving the reward function design
issue, existing methods for automated driving impose a linear structure
assumption on reward functions, making them difficult to apply to urban
automated driving. In light of these challenges, this paper proposes a novel
RL-based trajectory planning method that integrates RL with imitation learning
to enable multi-step planning. Furthermore, a transformer-based Bayesian reward
function is developed, providing effective reward signals for RL in urban
scenarios. Moreover, a hybrid-driven trajectory planning framework is proposed
to enhance safety and interpretability. The proposed methods were validated on
the large-scale real-world urban automated driving nuPlan dataset. Evaluated
using closed-loop metrics, the results demonstrated that the proposed method
significantly outperformed the baseline employing the identical policy model
structure and achieved competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art
method. The code is available at https://github.com/Zigned/nuplan_zigned.

                                        <span>  Understanding the 3D geometry of transparent objects from RGB images is
challenging due to their inherent physical properties, such as reflection and
refraction. To address these difficulties, especially in scenarios with sparse
views and dynamic environments, we introduce TRAN-D, a novel 2D Gaussian
Splatting-based depth reconstruction method for transparent objects. Our key
insight lies in separating transparent objects from the background, enabling
focused optimization of Gaussians corresponding to the object. We mitigate
artifacts with an object-aware loss that places Gaussians in obscured regions,
ensuring coverage of invisible surfaces while reducing overfitting.
Furthermore, we incorporate a physics-based simulation that refines the
reconstruction in just a few seconds, effectively handling object removal and
chain-reaction movement of remaining objects without the need for rescanning.
TRAN-D is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world sequences, and it
consistently demonstrated robust improvements over existing GS-based
state-of-the-art methods. In comparison with baselines, TRAN-D reduces the mean
absolute error by over 39% for the synthetic TRansPose sequences. Furthermore,
despite being updated using only one image, TRAN-D reaches a {\delta} < 2.5 cm
accuracy of 48.46%, over 1.5 times that of baselines, which uses six images.

comprehensive benchmark designed to ensure safety in humanoid autonomy and
teleoperation. Humanoid robots pose significant safety risks due to their
physical capabilities of interacting with complex environments. The physical
structures of humanoid robots further add complexity to the design of general
safety solutions. To facilitate safe deployment of complex robot systems, SPARK
can be used as a toolbox that comes with state-of-the-art safe control
algorithms in a modular and composable robot control framework. Users can
easily configure safety criteria and sensitivity levels to optimize the balance
between safety and performance. To accelerate humanoid safety research and
development, SPARK provides simulation benchmarks that compare safety
approaches in a variety of environments, tasks, and robot models. Furthermore,
SPARK allows quick deployment of synthesized safe controllers on real robots.
For hardware deployment, SPARK supports Apple Vision Pro (AVP) or a Motion
Capture System as external sensors, while offering interfaces for seamless
integration with alternative hardware setups at the same time. This paper
demonstrates SPARK's capability with both simulation experiments and case
studies with a Unitree G1 humanoid robot. Leveraging these advantages of SPARK,
users and researchers can significantly improve the safety of their humanoid
systems as well as accelerate relevant research. The open source code is

applications, such as VR/AR, autonomous vehicles. However, most existing
methods have difficulties in large-scale scenes due to three core challenges:
\textit{(a) inaccurate depth input.} Accurate depth input is impossible to get
in real-world large-scale scenes. \textit{(b) inaccurate pose estimation.} Most
existing approaches rely on accurate pre-estimated camera poses. \textit{(c)
insufficient scene representation capability.} A single global radiance field
lacks the capacity to effectively scale to large-scale scenes. To this end, we
propose an incremental joint learning framework, which can achieve accurate
depth, pose estimation, and large-scale scene reconstruction. A vision
transformer-based network is adopted as the backbone to enhance performance in
scale information estimation. For pose estimation, a feature-metric bundle
adjustment (FBA) method is designed for accurate and robust camera tracking in
large-scale scenes. In terms of implicit scene representation, we propose an
incremental scene representation method to construct the entire large-scale
scene as multiple local radiance fields to enhance the scalability of 3D scene
representation. Extended experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the
effectiveness and accuracy of our method in depth estimation, pose estimation,
and large-scale scene reconstruction.

vehicle localization, mapping and motion planning. Intersections offer strong
landmarks for correcting vehicle pose estimation, anchoring new sensor data in
up-to-date maps, and guiding vehicle routing in road network graphs. Despite
this importance, intersection localization has not been widely studied, with
existing methods either ignoring the rich semantic information already computed
onboard or relying on scarce, hand-labeled intersection datasets. To close this
gap, we present a novel LiDAR-based method for online vehicle-centric
intersection localization. We detect the intersection candidates in a bird's
eye view (BEV) representation formed by concatenating a sequence of semantic
road scans. We then refine these candidates by analyzing the intersecting road
branches and adjusting the intersection center point in a least-squares
formulation. For evaluation, we introduce an automated pipeline that pairs
localized intersection points with OpenStreetMap (OSM) intersection nodes using
precise GNSS/INS ground-truth poses. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI dataset
show that our method outperforms the latest learning-based baseline in accuracy
and reliability. Sensitivity tests demonstrate the method's robustness to

dual-process theory, employing a quad-process model of cognition. Expanding
upon System 1 (fast, intuitive thinking) and System 2 (slow, deliberative
thinking), we incorporate System 0, which represents pre-cognitive embodied
processes, and System 3, which encompasses collective intelligence and symbol
emergence. We contextualize this model within Bergson's philosophy by adopting
multi-scale time theory to unify the diverse temporal dynamics of cognition.
System 0 emphasizes morphological computation and passive dynamics,
illustrating how physical embodiment enables adaptive behavior without explicit
neural processing. Systems 1 and 2 are explained from a constructive
perspective, incorporating neurodynamical and AI viewpoints. In System 3, we
introduce collective predictive coding to explain how societal-level adaptation
and symbol emergence operate over extended timescales. This comprehensive
framework ranges from rapid embodied reactions to slow-evolving collective
intelligence, offering a unified perspective on cognition across multiple
timescales, levels of abstraction, and forms of human intelligence. The System
0/1/2/3 model provides a novel theoretical foundation for understanding the
interplay between adaptive and cognitive processes, thereby opening new avenues
for research in cognitive science, AI, robotics, and collective intelligence.

                                        <span>  The ability to perform reliable long-horizon task planning is crucial for
deploying robots in real-world environments. However, directly employing Large
Language Models (LLMs) as action sequence generators often results in low
success rates due to their limited reasoning ability for long-horizon embodied
tasks. In the STEP framework, we construct a subgoal tree through a pair of
closed-loop models: a subgoal decomposition model and a leaf node termination
model. Within this framework, we develop a hierarchical tree structure that
spans from coarse to fine resolutions. The subgoal decomposition model
leverages a foundation LLM to break down complex goals into manageable
subgoals, thereby spanning the subgoal tree. The leaf node termination model
provides real-time feedback based on environmental states, determining when to
terminate the tree spanning and ensuring each leaf node can be directly
converted into a primitive action. Experiments conducted in both the
VirtualHome WAH-NL benchmark and on real robots demonstrate that STEP achieves
long-horizon embodied task completion with success rates up to 34% (WAH-NL) and
25% (real robot) outperforming SOTA methods.

real-world performance remains underexplored due to proprietary systems and
limited data access. This paper presents OpenLKA, the first open, large-scale
dataset for LKA evaluation and improvement. It includes 400 hours of driving
data from 62 production vehicle models, collected through extensive road
testing in Tampa, Florida and global contributions from the Comma.ai driving
community. The dataset spans a wide range of challenging scenarios, including
complex road geometries, degraded lane markings, adverse weather, lighting
conditions and surrounding traffic. The dataset is multimodal, comprising: i)
full CAN bus streams, decoded using custom reverse-engineered DBC files to
extract key LKA events (e.g., system disengagements, lane detection failures);
ii) synchronized high-resolution dash-cam video; iii) real-time outputs from
Openpilot, providing accurate estimates of road curvature and lane positioning;
iv) enhanced scene annotations generated by Vision Language Models, describing
lane visibility, pavement quality, weather, lighting, and traffic conditions.
By integrating vehicle-internal signals with high-fidelity perception and rich
semantic context, OpenLKA provides a comprehensive platform for benchmarking
the real-world performance of production LKA systems, identifying
safety-critical operational scenarios, and assessing the readiness of current
road infrastructure for autonomous driving. The dataset is publicly available

                                        <span>  In this paper, we present an impedance control framework on the SE(3)
manifold, which enables force tracking while guaranteeing passivity. Building
upon the unified force-impedance control (UFIC) and our previous work on
geometric impedance control (GIC), we develop the geometric unified force
impedance control (GUFIC) to account for the SE(3) manifold structure in the
controller formulation using a differential geometric perspective. As in the
case of the UFIC, the GUFIC utilizes energy tank augmentation for both
force-tracking and impedance control to guarantee the manipulator's passivity
relative to external forces. This ensures that the end effector maintains safe
contact interaction with uncertain environments and tracks a desired
interaction force. Moreover, we resolve a non-causal implementation problem in
the UFIC formulation by introducing velocity and force fields. Due to its
formulation on SE(3), the proposed GUFIC inherits the desirable SE(3)
invariance and equivariance properties of the GIC, which helps increase sample
efficiency in machine learning applications where a learning algorithm is
incorporated into the control law. The proposed control law is validated in a
simulation environment under scenarios requiring tracking an SE(3) trajectory,
incorporating both position and orientation, while exerting a force on a
surface. The codes are available at

Chunking with Transformers (ACT). Traditional automation methods for oocyte

ACT enhances ACT by incorporating haptic feedback, enabling real-time grasp

results demonstrate that Haptic-Informed ACT improves the task success rate,
robustness, and adaptability compared to conventional ACT, particularly in
dynamic environments. These findings highlight the potential of multimodal

all aspects, many studies have focused on specific components, such as feature
extraction, graph-theoretic pruning, or pose solvers. In this paper, we take a
holistic view on the registration problem and develop an open-source and
versatile C++ library for point cloud registration, called KISS-Matcher.
KISS-Matcher combines a novel feature detector, Faster-PFH, that improves over
the classical fast point feature histogram (FPFH). Moreover, it adopts a
$k$-core-based graph-theoretic pruning to reduce the time complexity of
rejecting outlier correspondences. Finally, it combines these modules in a
complete, user-friendly, and ready-to-use pipeline. As verified by extensive
experiments, KISS-Matcher has superior scalability and broad applicability,
achieving a substantial speed-up compared to state-of-the-art outlier-robust
registration pipelines while preserving accuracy. Our code will be available at

                                        <span>  Exploration is a critical challenge in robotics, centered on understanding
unknown environments. In this work, we focus on robots exploring structured
indoor environments which are often predictable and composed of repeating
patterns. Most existing approaches, such as conventional frontier approaches,
have difficulty leveraging the predictability and explore with simple
heuristics such as `closest first'. Recent works use deep learning techniques
to predict unknown regions of the map, using these predictions for information
gain calculation. However, these approaches are often sensitive to the
predicted map quality or do not reason over sensor coverage. To overcome these
issues, our key insight is to jointly reason over what the robot can observe
and its uncertainty to calculate probabilistic information gain. We introduce
MapEx, a new exploration framework that uses predicted maps to form
probabilistic sensor model for information gain estimation. MapEx generates
multiple predicted maps based on observed information, and takes into
consideration both the computed variances of predicted maps and estimated
visible area to estimate the information gain of a given viewpoint. Experiments
on the real-world KTH dataset showed on average 12.4% improvement than
representative map-prediction based exploration and 25.4% improvement than
nearest frontier approach. Website: mapex-explorer.github.io

                                        <span>  Robot vision has greatly benefited from advancements in multimodal fusion
techniques and vision-language models (VLMs). We systematically review the
applications of multimodal fusion in key robotic vision tasks, including
semantic scene understanding, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), 3D
object detection, navigation and localization, and robot manipulation. We
compare VLMs based on large language models (LLMs) with traditional multimodal
fusion methods, analyzing their advantages, limitations, and synergies.
Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of commonly used datasets,
evaluating their applicability and challenges in real-world robotic scenarios.
Furthermore, we identify critical research challenges such as cross-modal
alignment, efficient fusion strategies, real-time deployment, and domain
adaptation, and propose future research directions, including self-supervised
learning for robust multimodal representations, transformer-based fusion
architectures, and scalable multimodal frameworks. Through a comprehensive
review, comparative analysis, and forward-looking discussion, we provide a
valuable reference for advancing multimodal perception and interaction in
robotic vision. A comprehensive list of studies in this survey is available at

                                        <span>  Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models aim to predict perceptual image quality
in alignment with human judgments. No-Reference (NR) IQA remains particularly
challenging due to the absence of a reference image. While deep learning has
significantly advanced this field, a major hurdle in developing NR-IQA models
is the limited availability of subjectively labeled data. Most existing deep
learning-based NR-IQA approaches rely on pre-training on large-scale datasets
before fine-tuning for IQA tasks. To further advance progress in this area, we
propose a novel approach that constructs a custom dataset using a limited
number of reference content images and introduces a no-reference IQA model that
incorporates both content and quality features for perceptual quality
prediction. Specifically, we train a quality-aware model using contrastive
triplet-based learning, enabling efficient training with fewer samples while
achieving strong generalization performance across publicly available datasets.

                                        <span>  Automated structural defect segmentation in civil infrastructure faces a
critical challenge: achieving high accuracy while maintaining computational
efficiency for real-time deployment. This paper presents FORTRESS
(Function-composition Optimized Real-Time Resilient Structural Segmentation), a
new architecture that balances accuracy and speed by using a special method
that combines depthwise separable convolutions with adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold
Network integration. FORTRESS incorporates three key innovations: a systematic
depthwise separable convolution framework achieving a 3.6x parameter reduction
per layer, adaptive TiKAN integration that selectively applies function
composition transformations only when computationally beneficial, and
multi-scale attention fusion combining spatial, channel, and KAN-enhanced
features across decoder levels. The architecture achieves remarkable efficiency
gains with 91% parameter reduction (31M to 2.9M), 91% computational complexity
reduction (13.7 to 1.17 GFLOPs), and 3x inference speed improvement while
delivering superior segmentation performance. Evaluation on benchmark
infrastructure datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art results with an F1- score
of 0.771 and a mean IoU of 0.677, significantly outperforming existing methods
including U-Net, SA-UNet, and U- KAN. The dual optimization strategy proves
essential for optimal performance, establishing FORTRESS as a robust solution
for practical structural defect segmentation in resource-constrained
environments where both accuracy and computational efficiency are paramount.

                                        <span>  Background/Objectives: Age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, diabetic
retinopathy (DR), diabetic macular edema, and pathological myopia affect
hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Early screening for these diseases is
essential, yet access to medical care remains limited in low- and middle-income
countries as well as in resource-limited settings. We develop InSight, an
AI-based app that combines patient metadata with fundus images for accurate
diagnosis of five common eye diseases to improve accessibility of screenings.
  Methods: InSight features a three-stage pipeline: real-time image quality
assessment, disease diagnosis model, and a DR grading model to assess severity.
Our disease diagnosis model incorporates three key innovations: (a) Multimodal
fusion technique (MetaFusion) combining clinical metadata and images; (b)
Pretraining method leveraging supervised and self-supervised loss functions;
and (c) Multitask model to simultaneously predict 5 diseases. We make use of
BRSET (lab-captured images) and mBRSET (smartphone-captured images) datasets,
both of which also contain clinical metadata for model training/evaluation.
  Results: Trained on a dataset of BRSET and mBRSET images, the image quality
checker achieves near-100% accuracy in filtering out low-quality fundus images.
The multimodal pretrained disease diagnosis model outperforms models using only
images by 6% in balanced accuracy for BRSET and 4% for mBRSET.
  Conclusions: The InSight pipeline demonstrates robustness across varied image
conditions and has high diagnostic accuracy across all five diseases,
generalizing to both smartphone and lab captured images. The multitask model
contributes to the lightweight nature of the pipeline, making it five times
computationally efficient compared to having five individual models
corresponding to each disease.

                                        <span>  Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading global cause of mortality,
yet current risk stratification methods often fail to detect early, subclinical
changes. Previous studies have generally not integrated retinal
microvasculature characteristics with comprehensive serum lipidomic profiles as
potential indicators of CVD risk. In this study, an innovative imaging omics
framework was introduced, combining retinal microvascular traits derived
through deep learning based image processing with serum lipidomic data to
highlight asymptomatic biomarkers of cardiovascular risk beyond the
conventional lipid panel. This represents the first large scale, covariate
adjusted and stratified correlation analysis conducted in a healthy population,
which is essential for identifying early indicators of disease. Retinal
phenotypes were quantified using automated image analysis tools, while serum
lipid profiling was performed by Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography
Electrospray ionization High resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC ESI HRMS).
Strong, age- and sex-independent correlations were established, particularly
between average artery width, vessel density, and lipid subclasses such as
triacylglycerols (TAGs), diacylglycerols (DAGs), and ceramides (Cers). These
associations suggest a converging mechanism of microvascular remodeling under
metabolic stress. By linking detailed
  vascular structural phenotypes to specific lipid species, this study fills a
critical gap in the understanding of early CVD pathogenesis. This integration
not only offers a novel perspective on microvascular metabolic associations but
also presents a significant opportunity for the identification of robust,
non-invasive biomarkers. Ultimately, these findings may support improved early
detection, targeted prevention, and personalized approaches in cardiovascular
healthcare.

Prior approaches rely on costly test-time optimization of 4D representations or
do not preserve scene geometry when trained in a feed-forward manner. Our
approach is based on three key insights: (1) covisible pixels (that are visible
in both the input and target views) can be rendered by first reconstructing the
dynamic 3D scene and rendering the reconstruction from the novel-views and (2)
hidden pixels in novel views can be "inpainted" with feed-forward 2D video
diffusion models. Notably, our video inpainting diffusion model (CogNVS) can be
self-supervised from 2D videos, allowing us to train it on a large corpus of
in-the-wild videos. This in turn allows for (3) CogNVS to be applied zero-shot
to novel test videos via test-time finetuning. We empirically verify that
CogNVS outperforms almost all prior art for novel-view synthesis of dynamic
scenes from monocular videos.

                                        <span>  The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging has
revolutionized diagnostic practices, enabling advanced analysis and
interpretation of radiological data. This study presents a comprehensive
evaluation of radiomics-based and deep learning-based approaches for disease
detection in chest radiography, focusing on COVID-19, lung opacity, and viral
pneumonia. While deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural
networks and vision transformers, learn directly from image data,
radiomics-based models extract handcrafted features, offering potential
advantages in data-limited scenarios. We systematically compared the diagnostic
performance of various AI models, including Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting,
Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Multi-Layer Perceptrons for
radiomics, against state-of-the-art deep learning models such as InceptionV3,
EfficientNetL, and ConvNeXtXLarge. Performance was evaluated across multiple
sample sizes. At 24 samples, EfficientNetL achieved an AUC of 0.839,
outperforming SVM with an AUC of 0.762. At 4000 samples, InceptionV3 achieved
the highest AUC of 0.996, compared to 0.885 for Random Forest. A
Scheirer-Ray-Hare test confirmed significant main and interaction effects of
model type and sample size on all metrics. Post hoc Mann-Whitney U tests with
Bonferroni correction further revealed consistent performance advantages for
deep learning models across most conditions. These findings provide
statistically validated, data-driven recommendations for model selection in
diagnostic AI. Deep learning models demonstrated higher performance and better
scalability with increasing data availability, while radiomics-based models may
remain useful in low-data contexts. This study addresses a critical gap in
AI-based diagnostic research by offering practical guidance for deploying AI
models across diverse clinical environments.

                                        <span>  Volumetric reconstruction of dynamic scenes is an important problem in
computer vision. It is especially challenging in poor lighting and with fast
motion. This is partly due to limitations of RGB cameras: To capture frames
under low lighting, the exposure time needs to be increased, which leads to
more motion blur. In contrast, event cameras, which record changes in pixel
brightness asynchronously, are much less dependent on lighting, making them
more suitable for recording fast motion. We hence propose the first method to
spatiotemporally reconstruct a scene from sparse multi-view event streams and
sparse RGB frames. We train a sequence of cross-faded time-conditioned NeRF
models, one per short recording segment. The individual segments are supervised
with a set of event- and RGB-based losses and sparse-view regularisation. We
assemble a real-world multi-view camera rig with six static event cameras
around the object and record a benchmark multi-view event stream dataset of
challenging motions. Our work outperforms RGB-based baselines, producing
state-of-the-art results, and opens up the topic of multi-view event-based
reconstruction as a new path for fast scene capture beyond RGB cameras. The
code and the data are released at https://4dqv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/DynEventNeRF/

                                        <span>  Humans naturally share information with those they are connected to, and
video has become one of the dominant mediums for communication and expression
on the Internet. To support the creation of high-quality large-scale video
content, a modern pipeline requires a comprehensive understanding of both the
raw input materials (e.g., the unedited footage captured by cameras) and the
editing components (e.g., visual effects). In video editing scenarios, models
must process multiple modalities (e.g., vision, audio, text) with strong
background knowledge and handle flexible input lengths (e.g., hour-long raw
videos), which poses significant challenges for traditional models. In this
report, we introduce Vidi, a family of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for a
wide range of video understand editing scenarios. The first release focuses on
temporal retrieval, i.e., identifying the time ranges within the input videos
corresponding to a given text query, which plays a critical role in intelligent
editing. The model is capable of processing hour-long videos with strong
temporal understanding capability, e.g., retrieve time ranges for certain
queries. To support a comprehensive evaluation in real-world scenarios, we also
present the VUE-TR benchmark, which introduces five key advancements. 1) Video
duration: significantly longer than videos of existing temporal retrival
datasets, 2) Audio support: includes audio-based queries, 3) Query format:
diverse query lengths/formats, 4) Annotation quality: ground-truth time ranges
are manually annotated. 5) Evaluation metric: a refined IoU metric to support
evaluation over multiple time ranges. Remarkably, Vidi significantly
outperforms leading proprietary models, e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini, on the
temporal retrieval task, indicating its superiority in video editing scenarios.

                                        <span>  Most crowd counting methods directly regress blockwise density maps using
Mean Squared Error (MSE) losses. This practice has two key limitations: (1) it
fails to account for the extreme spatial sparsity of annotations -- over 95% of
8x8 blocks are empty across standard benchmarks, so supervision signals in
informative regions are diluted by the predominant zeros; (2) MSE corresponds
to a Gaussian error model that poorly matches discrete, non-negative count
data. To address these issues, we introduce ZIP, a scalable crowd counting
framework that models blockwise counts with a Zero-Inflated Poisson likelihood:
a zero-inflation term learns the probability a block is structurally empty
(handling excess zeros), while the Poisson component captures expected counts
when people are present (respecting discreteness). We provide a generalization
analysis showing a tighter risk bound for ZIP than MSE-based losses and DMCount
provided that the training resolution is moderately large. To assess the
scalability of ZIP, we instantiate it on backbones spanning over 100x in
parameters/compute. Experiments on ShanghaiTech A & B, UCF-QNRF, and NWPU-Crowd
demonstrate that ZIP consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods across all
model scales.

Recently, linear classifiers (called "deception probes") have been trained to
distinguish the internal activations of a language model during deceptive
versus honest responses. However, it's unclear how effective these probes are
at detecting deception in practice, nor whether such probes are resistant to
simple counter strategies from a deceptive assistant who wishes to evade
detection. In this paper, we compare white-box monitoring (where the monitor
has access to token-level probe activations) to black-box monitoring (without
such access). We benchmark deception probes by the extent to which the white
box monitor outperforms the black-box monitor, i.e. the black-to-white
performance boost. We find weak but encouraging black-to-white performance
boosts from existing deception probes.

factors, making its utilization complex. This uncertainty, particularly
resulting from disparities in data formats, frequently necessitates the
involvement of experts to find resolutions. Current methodologies primarily
address conflicts related to data structures and schemas, often overlooking the
pivotal role played by data transformation. As the utilization of artificial
intelligence (AI) continues to expand, there is a growing demand for a more
streamlined data preparation process, and data transformation becomes
paramount. It customizes training data to enhance AI learning efficiency and
adapts input formats to suit diverse AI models. Selecting an appropriate
transformation technique is paramount in preserving crucial data details.
Despite the widespread integration of AI across various industries,

                                        <span>  Automated structural defect segmentation in civil infrastructure faces a
critical challenge: achieving high accuracy while maintaining computational
efficiency for real-time deployment. This paper presents FORTRESS
(Function-composition Optimized Real-Time Resilient Structural Segmentation), a
new architecture that balances accuracy and speed by using a special method
that combines depthwise separable convolutions with adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold
Network integration. FORTRESS incorporates three key innovations: a systematic
depthwise separable convolution framework achieving a 3.6x parameter reduction
per layer, adaptive TiKAN integration that selectively applies function
composition transformations only when computationally beneficial, and
multi-scale attention fusion combining spatial, channel, and KAN-enhanced
features across decoder levels. The architecture achieves remarkable efficiency
gains with 91% parameter reduction (31M to 2.9M), 91% computational complexity
reduction (13.7 to 1.17 GFLOPs), and 3x inference speed improvement while
delivering superior segmentation performance. Evaluation on benchmark
infrastructure datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art results with an F1- score
of 0.771 and a mean IoU of 0.677, significantly outperforming existing methods
including U-Net, SA-UNet, and U- KAN. The dual optimization strategy proves
essential for optimal performance, establishing FORTRESS as a robust solution
for practical structural defect segmentation in resource-constrained
environments where both accuracy and computational efficiency are paramount.

tasks, but can they generate student-like code like real students - imperfect,
iterative, and stylistically diverse? We present ParaStudent, a systematic
study of LLM-based "student-like" code generation in an introductory
programming course setting. Using a dataset of timestamped student submissions
across multiple semesters, we design low- and high-resolution experiments to
model student progress and evaluate code outputs along semantic, functional,
and stylistic dimensions. Our results show that fine-tuning significantly
improves alignment with real student trajectories and captures error patterns,
incremental improvements, and stylistic variations more faithfully. This study
shows that modeling realistic student code requires capturing learning dynamics
through context-aware generation, temporal modeling, and multi-dimensional
evaluation. Code for experiments and evaluation is available at

retinopathy (DR), diabetic macular edema, and pathological myopia affect
hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Early screening for these diseases is
essential, yet access to medical care remains limited in low- and middle-income
countries as well as in resource-limited settings. We develop InSight, an
AI-based app that combines patient metadata with fundus images for accurate
diagnosis of five common eye diseases to improve accessibility of screenings.
  Methods: InSight features a three-stage pipeline: real-time image quality
assessment, disease diagnosis model, and a DR grading model to assess severity.
Our disease diagnosis model incorporates three key innovations: (a) Multimodal
fusion technique (MetaFusion) combining clinical metadata and images; (b)
Pretraining method leveraging supervised and self-supervised loss functions;
and (c) Multitask model to simultaneously predict 5 diseases. We make use of
BRSET (lab-captured images) and mBRSET (smartphone-captured images) datasets,
both of which also contain clinical metadata for model training/evaluation.
  Results: Trained on a dataset of BRSET and mBRSET images, the image quality
checker achieves near-100% accuracy in filtering out low-quality fundus images.
The multimodal pretrained disease diagnosis model outperforms models using only
images by 6% in balanced accuracy for BRSET and 4% for mBRSET.
  Conclusions: The InSight pipeline demonstrates robustness across varied image
conditions and has high diagnostic accuracy across all five diseases,
generalizing to both smartphone and lab captured images. The multitask model
contributes to the lightweight nature of the pipeline, making it five times
computationally efficient compared to having five individual models
corresponding to each disease.

                                        <span>  Game design hinges on understanding how static rules and content translate
into dynamic player behavior - something modern generative systems that inspect
only a game's code or assets struggle to capture. We present an automated
design iteration framework that closes this gap by pairing a reinforcement
learning (RL) agent, which playtests the game, with a large multimodal model
(LMM), which revises the game based on what the agent does. In each loop the RL
player completes several episodes, producing (i) numerical play metrics and/or
(ii) a compact image strip summarising recent video frames. The LMM designer
receives a gameplay goal and the current game configuration, analyses the play
traces, and edits the configuration to steer future behaviour toward the goal.
We demonstrate results that LMMs can reason over behavioral traces supplied by
RL agents to iteratively refine game mechanics, pointing toward practical,
scalable tools for AI-assisted game design.

approach to software development using large language models (LLMs). In
contrast to ad hoc interactions with generative AI, SCM emphasizes a structured
and persistent development dialogue, where all stages of a project - from
requirements to architecture and implementation - unfold within a single,
long-context conversation. The methodology is grounded on principles of
cognitive clarity, traceability, modularity, and documentation. We define its
phases, best practices, and philosophical stance, while arguing that SCM offers
a necessary correction to the passive reliance on LLMs prevalent in current
practices. We aim to reassert the active role of the developer as architect and
supervisor of the intelligent tool.

                                        <span>  User specifications or legal frameworks often require information to be
removed from pretrained models, including large language models (LLMs). This
requires deleting or "forgetting" a set of data points from an already-trained
model, which typically degrades its performance on other data points. Thus, a
balance must be struck between removing information and keeping the model's
other abilities intact, with a failure to balance this trade-off leading to
poor deletion or an unusable model. To this end, we propose UPCORE
(Utility-Preserving Coreset Selection), a method-agnostic data selection
framework for mitigating collateral damage during unlearning. Finding that the
model damage is correlated with the variance of the model's representations on
the forget set, we selectively prune the forget set to remove outliers, thereby
minimizing model degradation after unlearning. Across three standard unlearning
methods, UPCORE consistently achieves a superior balance between the competing
objectives of deletion efficacy and model preservation. To better evaluate this
trade-off, we introduce a new metric, measuring the area-under-the-curve (AUC)
across standard metrics. Our results show that UPCORE improves both standard
metrics and AUC, benefiting from positive transfer between the coreset and
pruned points while reducing negative transfer from the forget set to points
outside of it.

                                        <span>  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks but
also pose significant risks of generating harmful content, particularly through
jailbreak attacks. Jailbreak attacks refer to intentional manipulations that
bypass safety mechanisms in models, leading to the generation of inappropriate
or unsafe content. Detecting such attacks is critical to ensuring the
responsible deployment of MLLMs. Existing jailbreak detection methods face
three primary challenges: (1) Many rely on model hidden states or gradients,
limiting their applicability to white-box models, where the internal workings
of the model are accessible; (2) They involve high computational overhead from
uncertainty-based analysis, which limits real-time detection, and (3) They
require fully labeled harmful datasets, which are often scarce in real-world
settings. To address these issues, we introduce a test-time adaptive framework
called JAILDAM. Our method leverages a memory-based approach guided by
policy-driven unsafe knowledge representations, eliminating the need for
explicit exposure to harmful data. By dynamically updating unsafe knowledge
during test-time, our framework improves generalization to unseen jailbreak
strategies while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on multiple VLM jailbreak
benchmarks demonstrate that JAILDAM delivers state-of-the-art performance in
harmful content detection, improving both accuracy and speed.

                                        <span>  In robotics, the effective integration of environmental data into actionable
knowledge remains a significant challenge due to the variety and
incompatibility of data formats commonly used in scene descriptions, such as
MJCF, URDF, and SDF. This paper presents a novel approach that addresses these
challenges by developing a unified scene graph model that standardizes these
varied formats into the Universal Scene Description (USD) format. This
standardization facilitates the integration of these scene graphs with robot
ontologies through semantic reporting, enabling the translation of complex
environmental data into actionable knowledge essential for cognitive robotic
control. We evaluated our approach by converting procedural 3D environments
into USD format, which is then annotated semantically and translated into a
knowledge graph to effectively answer competency questions, demonstrating its
utility for real-time robotic decision-making. Additionally, we developed a
web-based visualization tool to support the semantic mapping process, providing
users with an intuitive interface to manage the 3D environment.

in task generalization at different levels. In this work, we propose FOUNDER, a
framework that integrates the generalizable knowledge embedded in FMs with the
dynamic modeling capabilities of WMs to enable open-ended task solving in
embodied environments in a reward-free manner. We learn a mapping function that
grounds FM representations in the WM state space, effectively inferring the
agent's physical states in the world simulator from external observations. This
mapping enables the learning of a goal-conditioned policy through imagination
during behavior learning, with the mapped task serving as the goal state. Our
method leverages the predicted temporal distance to the goal state as an
informative reward signal. FOUNDER demonstrates superior performance on various
multi-task offline visual control benchmarks, excelling in capturing the
deep-level semantics of tasks specified by text or videos, particularly in
scenarios involving complex observations or domain gaps where prior methods
struggle. The consistency of our learned reward function with the ground-truth
reward is also empirically validated. Our project website is

i.e., more humanlike sim agents, is essential for developing autonomous vehicle
technology. In the context of highway merging, previous works have studied the
operational-level yielding dynamics of lag vehicles in response to a merging
car at highway on-ramps. Other works focusing on tactical decision modeling
generally consider limited action sets or utilize payoff functions with large
parameter sets and limited payoff bounds. In this work, we aim to improve the
simulation of the highway merge scenario by targeting a game theoretic model
for tactical decision-making with improved payoff functions and lag actions. We
couple this with an underlying dynamics model to have a unified decision and
dynamics model that can capture merging interactions and simulate more
realistic interactions in an explainable and interpretable fashion. The
proposed model demonstrated good reproducibility of complex interactions when
validated on a real-world dataset. The model was finally integrated into a high
fidelity simulation environment and confirmed to have adequate computation time
efficiency for use in large-scale simulations to support autonomous vehicle
development.

so will the need for mobility solutions that promote independent living and
social integration. Wheelchairs are vital for the mobility of PWD in both
indoor and outdoor environments. The current SOTA in powered wheelchairs is
based on either manually controlled or fully autonomous modes of operation,
offering limited flexibility and often proving difficult to navigate in
spatially constrained environments. Moreover, research on robotic wheelchairs
has focused predominantly on complete autonomy or improved manual control;
approaches that can compromise efficiency and user trust. To overcome these
challenges, this paper introduces the CoNav Chair, a smart wheelchair based on
the Robot Operating System (ROS) and featuring shared control navigation and
obstacle avoidance capabilities that are intended to enhance navigational
efficiency, safety, and ease of use for the user. The paper outlines the CoNav
Chair's design and presents a preliminary usability evaluation comparing three
distinct navigation modes, namely, manual, shared, and fully autonomous,
conducted with 21 healthy, unimpaired participants traversing an indoor
building environment. Study findings indicated that the shared control
navigation framework had significantly fewer collisions and performed
comparably, if not superior to the autonomous and manual modes, on task
completion time, trajectory length, and smoothness; and was perceived as being
safer and more efficient based on user reported subjective assessments of
usability. Overall, the CoNav system demonstrated acceptable safety and
performance, laying the foundation for subsequent usability testing with end
users, namely, PWDs who rely on a powered wheelchair for mobility.

solutions for faster rendering or handling dynamic scenes have been proposed,
LiDAR specific effects remain insufficiently addressed. By explicitly modeling
sensor characteristics such as rolling shutter, laser power variations, and
intensity falloff, our method achieves more accurate LiDAR simulation compared
to existing techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
through quantitative and qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-art methods,
as well as ablation studies that highlight the importance of each sensor model
component. Beyond that, we show that our approach exhibits advanced
resimulation capabilities, such as generating high resolution LiDAR scans in

                                        <span>  Verifiers -- functions assigning rewards to agent behavior -- have been key
for AI progress in domains like math and board games. However, extending these
gains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains
a challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this
intuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language
Models(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge,
human-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as
verifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and
robotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a
strong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often
generating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is
pervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several
methods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs
despite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To
address this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method
that enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing
their own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV
operates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors
about task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then,
conditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate
trajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in
accuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of
heterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld,
a diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting
a new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%.

                                        <span>  Global localization is critical for autonomous navigation, particularly in
scenarios where an agent must localize within a map generated in a different
session or by another agent, as agents often have no prior knowledge about the
correlation between reference frames. However, this task remains challenging in
unstructured environments due to appearance changes induced by viewpoint
variation, seasonal changes, spatial aliasing, and occlusions -- known failure
modes for traditional place recognition methods. To address these challenges,
we propose VISTA (View-Invariant Segmentation-Based Tracking for Frame
Alignment), a novel open-set, monocular global localization framework that
combines: 1) a front-end, object-based, segmentation and tracking pipeline,
followed by 2) a submap correspondence search, which exploits geometric
consistencies between environment maps to align vehicle reference frames. VISTA
enables consistent localization across diverse camera viewpoints and seasonal
changes, without requiring any domain-specific training or finetuning. We
evaluate VISTA on seasonal and oblique-angle aerial datasets, achieving up to a
69% improvement in recall over baseline methods. Furthermore, we maintain a
compact object-based map that is only 0.6% the size of the most
memory-conservative baseline, making our approach capable of real-time
implementation on resource-constrained platforms.

                                        <span>  Highway on-ramp merging areas are common bottlenecks to traffic congestion
and accidents. Currently, a cooperative control strategy based on connected and
automated vehicles (CAVs) is a fundamental solution to this problem. While CAVs
are not fully widespread, it is necessary to propose a hierarchical cooperative
on-ramp merging control (HCOMC) framework for heterogeneous traffic flow on
two-lane highways to address this gap. This paper extends longitudinal
car-following models based on the intelligent driver model and lateral
lane-changing models using the quintic polynomial curve to account for
human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs, comprehensively considering human
factors and cooperative adaptive cruise control. Besides, this paper proposes a
HCOMC framework, consisting of a hierarchical cooperative planning model based
on the modified virtual vehicle model, a discretionary lane-changing model
based on game theory, and a multi-objective optimization model using the
elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm to ensure the safe, smooth, and
efficient merging process. Then, the performance of our HCOMC is analyzed under
different traffic densities and CAV penetration rates through simulation. The
findings underscore our HCOMC's pronounced comprehensive advantages in
enhancing the safety of group vehicles, stabilizing and expediting merging
process, optimizing traffic efficiency, and economizing fuel consumption
compared with benchmarks.

safety-critical human-robot interaction, particularly in domains such as
surgery. To address this, we propose a framework that uses Large Language
Models (LLMs) for ambiguity detection specifically designed for collaborative
surgical scenarios. Our method employs an ensemble of LLM evaluators, each
configured with distinct prompting techniques to identify linguistic,
contextual, procedural, and critical ambiguities. A chain-of-thought evaluator
is included to systematically analyze instruction structure for potential
issues. Individual evaluator assessments are synthesized through conformal
prediction, which yields non-conformity scores based on comparison to a labeled
calibration dataset. Evaluating Llama 3.2 11B and Gemma 3 12B, we observed
classification accuracy exceeding 60% in differentiating ambiguous from
unambiguous surgical instructions. Our approach improves the safety and
reliability of human-robot collaboration in surgery by offering a mechanism to
identify potentially ambiguous instructions before robot action.

tasks for a team of holonomic robots with access to the full environment
information. The framework invokes two processes asynchronously at high
frequency: (i) a centralized, discrete, and full-horizon planner for computing
collision- and deadlock-free paths rapidly, leveraging recent advances in
multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF), and (ii) dynamics-aware, robot-wise optimal
trajectory controllers that ensure all robots independently follow their
assigned paths reliably. This hierarchical shift in planning representation
from (i) discrete and coupled to (ii) continuous and decoupled domains enables
the framework to maintain long-term scalable motion synthesis. As an
instantiation of this idea, we present LF, which combines a fast
state-of-the-art MAPF solver (LaCAM), and a robust feedback control stack
(Freyja) for executing agile robot maneuvers. LF provides a robust and

research, driven by the increasing capability of autonomous robotic systems to
assist surgeons in complex procedures. This systematic review examines the
advancements and persistent challenges in the development of autonomous
surgical robotic assistants (ASARs), focusing specifically on scenarios where
robots provide meaningful and active support to human surgeons. Adhering to the
PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive literature search was conducted across the
IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, resulting in the selection
of 32 studies for detailed analysis. Two primary collaborative setups were
identified: teleoperation-based assistance and direct hands-on interaction. The
findings reveal a growing research emphasis on ASARs, with predominant
applications currently in endoscope guidance, alongside emerging progress in
autonomous tool manipulation. Several key challenges hinder wider adoption,
including the alignment of robotic actions with human surgeon preferences, the
necessity for procedural awareness within autonomous systems, the establishment
of seamless human-robot information exchange, and the complexities of skill
acquisition in shared workspaces. This review synthesizes current trends,
identifies critical limitations, and outlines future research directions

set of low-cost, compact, and lightweight sensors to achieve low-drift pose and
velocity estimation under challenging locomotion conditions. The key idea is to
leverage multiple inertial measurement units on different links of the robot to
correct a major error source in standard proprioceptive odometry. We fuse the
inertial sensor information and joint encoder measurements in an extended
Kalman filter, then combine the velocity estimate from this filter with camera
data in a factor-graph-based sliding-window estimator to form a
visual-inertial-leg odometry method. We validate our state estimator through
comprehensive theoretical analysis and hardware experiments performed using
real-world robot data collected during a variety of challenging locomotion
tasks. Our algorithm consistently achieves minimal position deviation, even in
scenarios involving substantial ground impact, foot slippage, and sudden body
rotations. A C++ implementation, along with a large-scale dataset, is available

                                        <span>  The RoboCup Logistics League is a RoboCup competition in a smart factory
scenario that has focused on task planning, job scheduling, and multi-agent
coordination. The focus on production logistics allowed teams to develop highly
competitive strategies, but also meant that some recent developments in the
context of smart manufacturing are not reflected in the competition, weakening
its relevance over the years. In this paper, we describe the vision for the
RoboCup Smart Manufacturing League, a new competition designed as a larger
smart manufacturing scenario, reflecting all the major aspects of a modern
factory. It will consist of several tracks that are initially independent but
gradually combined into one smart manufacturing scenario. The new tracks will
cover industrial robotics challenges such as assembly, human-robot
collaboration, and humanoid robotics, but also retain a focus on production
logistics. We expect the reenvisioned competition to be more attractive to
newcomers and well-tried teams, while also shifting the focus to current and
future challenges of industrial robotics.

                                        <span>  Mobile robots are increasingly required to navigate and interact within
unknown and unstructured environments to meet human demands. Demand-driven
navigation (DDN) enables robots to identify and locate objects based on
implicit human intent, even when object locations are unknown. However,
traditional data-driven DDN methods rely on pre-collected data for model
training and decision-making, limiting their generalization capability in
unseen scenarios. In this paper, we propose CogDDN, a VLM-based framework that
emulates the human cognitive and learning mechanisms by integrating fast and
slow thinking systems and selectively identifying key objects essential to
fulfilling user demands. CogDDN identifies appropriate target objects by
semantically aligning detected objects with the given instructions.
Furthermore, it incorporates a dual-process decision-making module, comprising
a Heuristic Process for rapid, efficient decisions and an Analytic Process that
analyzes past errors, accumulates them in a knowledge base, and continuously
improves performance. Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning strengthens the
decision-making process. Extensive closed-loop evaluations on the AI2Thor
simulator with the ProcThor dataset show that CogDDN outperforms single-view
camera-only methods by 15%, demonstrating significant improvements in
navigation accuracy and adaptability. The project page is available at

of which have no dedicated sense of gravity. Flying robots, on the other hand,
typically depend heavily on accelerometers and gyroscopes for attitude
stabilization. In this work, we present the first vision-only approach to
flight control for use in generic environments. We show that a quadrotor drone
equipped with a downward-facing event camera can estimate its attitude and
rotation rate from just the event stream, enabling flight control without
inertial sensors. Our approach uses a small recurrent convolutional neural
network trained through supervised learning. Real-world flight tests
demonstrate that our combination of event camera and low-latency neural network
is capable of replacing the inertial measurement unit in a traditional flight
control loop. Furthermore, we investigate the network's generalization across
different environments, and the impact of memory and different fields of view.
While networks with memory and access to horizon-like visual cues achieve best
performance, variants with a narrower field of view achieve better relative
generalization. Our work showcases vision-only flight control as a promising
candidate for enabling autonomous, insect-scale flying robots.

                                        <span>  Bimanual manipulation is crucial in robotics, enabling complex tasks in
industrial automation and household services. However, it poses significant
challenges due to the high-dimensional action space and intricate coordination
requirements. While video prediction has been recently studied for
representation learning and control, leveraging its ability to capture rich
dynamic and behavioral information, its potential for enhancing bimanual
coordination remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified
diffusion-based framework for the joint optimization of video and action
prediction. Specifically, we propose a multi-frame latent prediction strategy
that encodes future states in a compressed latent space, preserving
task-relevant features. Furthermore, we introduce a unidirectional attention
mechanism where video prediction is conditioned on the action, while action
prediction remains independent of video prediction. This design allows us to
omit video prediction during inference, significantly enhancing efficiency.
Experiments on two simulated benchmarks and a real-world setting demonstrate a
significant improvement in the success rate over the strong baseline ACT using
our method, achieving a \textbf{24.9\%} increase on ALOHA, an \textbf{11.1\%}
increase on RoboTwin, and a \textbf{32.5\%} increase in real-world experiments.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we study task-oriented human grasp synthesis, a new grasp
synthesis task that demands both task and context awareness. At the core of our
method is the task-aware contact maps. Unlike traditional contact maps that
only reason about the manipulated object and its relation with the hand, our
enhanced maps take into account scene and task information. This comprehensive
map is critical for hand-object interaction, enabling accurate grasping poses
that align with the task. We propose a two-stage pipeline that first constructs
a task-aware contact map informed by the scene and task. In the subsequent
stage, we use this contact map to synthesize task-oriented human grasps. We
introduce a new dataset and a metric for the proposed task to evaluate our
approach. Our experiments validate the importance of modeling both scene and
task, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods in both
grasp quality and task performance. See our project page for more details:

approach for robust autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) control, addressing key
challenges in underwater trajectory planning and dynamic environment
adaptation. The proposed method integrates three core innovations: (1) A
diffusion-based trajectory generation framework that produces physically
feasible multi-step trajectories, enhanced by a high-dimensional state encoding
mechanism combining current observations with historical states and actions
through a novel diffusion U-Net architecture, significantly improving
long-horizon planning. (2) A sample-efficient hybrid learning architecture that
synergizes diffusion-guided exploration with RL policy optimization, where the
diffusion model generates diverse candidate actions and the RL critic selects
optimal actions, achieving higher exploration efficiency and policy stability
in dynamic underwater environments. Extensive simulation experiments validating
the method's superior robustness and flexibility, outperforms conventional
control methods in challenging marine conditions, offering enhanced
adaptability and reliability for AUV operations in the underwater tasks.

                                        <span>  The COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected public health, healthcare
systems, and daily life, especially amid resource shortages and limited
workers. This crisis has underscored the urgent need for automation in hospital
environments, particularly disinfection, which is crucial to controlling virus
transmission and improving the safety of healthcare personnel and patients.
Ultraviolet (UV) light disinfection, known for its high efficiency, has been
widely adopted in hospital settings. However, most existing research focuses on
maximizing UV coverage while paying little attention to the impact of human
activity on virus distribution. To address this issue, we propose a mobile
robotic system for UV disinfection focusing on the virus hotspot. The system
prioritizes disinfection in high-risk areas and employs an approach for
optimized UV dosage to ensure that all surfaces receive an adequate level of UV
exposure while significantly reducing disinfection time. It not only improves
disinfection efficiency but also minimizes unnecessary exposure in low-risk
areas. In two representative hospital scenarios, our method achieves the same
disinfection effectiveness while reducing disinfection time by 30.7% and 31.9%,
respectively. The video of the experiment is available at:

of advanced automated driving functions. In this paper, we investigate the
effects of scaling on self-localization accuracy with visual and
visual-inertial algorithms using cameras and an inertial measurement unit
(IMU). For this purpose, ROS2-compatible visual and visual-inertial algorithms
are selected, and datasets are chosen as a baseline for real-sized vehicles. A
test drive is conducted to record data of reduced-scale vehicles. We compare
the selected localization algorithms, OpenVINS, VINS-Fusion, and RTAB-Map, in
terms of their pose accuracy against the ground-truth and against data from
real-sized vehicles. When comparing the implementation of the selected
localization algorithms to real-sized vehicles, OpenVINS has the lowest average
localization error. Although all selected localization algorithms have
overlapping error ranges, OpenVINS also performs best when applied to a
reduced-scale vehicle. When reduced-scale vehicles were compared to real-sized
vehicles, minor differences were found in translational vehicle motion
estimation accuracy. However, no significant differences were found when
comparing the estimation accuracy of rotational vehicle motion, allowing RSVRs
to be used as testing platforms for self-localization algorithms.

robotic manipulation in cluttered, unmodeled environments. The system
integrates a dual-camera perception setup with a B-spline-based model
predictive control (MPC) scheme. Initially, the planner generates feasible
global trajectories from partial and uncertain observations. As new visual data
are incrementally fused, both the environment model and motion planning are
progressively refined. A vision-based cost function promotes target-driven
exploration, while a refined kernel-perceptron collision detector enables
efficient constraint updates for real-time planning. The framework accommodates
closed-chain kinematics and supports dynamic replanning. Experiments on a
multi-arm platform validate its robustness and adaptability under uncertainties
and clutter.

linearization strategy to ensure precise trajectory tracking for an important
family of Lagrangian systems. We assume a nominal knowledge of the dynamics is
given but no a-priori bounds on the model mismatch are available. In our
approach, the key ingredient is the adoption of a regression framework based on
Gaussian Processes (GPR) to estimate the model mismatch. This estimate is added
to the outer loop of a classical feedback linearization scheme based on the
nominal knowledge available. Then, to compensate for the residual uncertainty,
we robustify the controller including an additional term whose size is designed
based on the variance provided by the GPR framework. We proved that, with high
probability, the proposed scheme is able to guarantee asymptotic tracking of a
desired trajectory. We tested numerically our strategy on a 2 degrees of
freedom planar robot.

requires smooth trajectories but also the time derivatives of the control
forces/torques, hence of the EOM. This paper presents the time derivatives of
the EOM in closed form up to second-order as an alternative formulation to the
existing recursive algorithms for this purpose, which provides a direct insight
into the structure of the derivatives. The Lie group formulation for rigid body
systems is used giving rise to very compact and easily parameterized equations.

                                        <span>  This study presents an advanced approach to enhance robotic manipulation in
uncertain and challenging environments, with a focus on autonomous operations
augmented by human-in-the-loop (HITL) control for lunar missions. By
integrating human decision-making with autonomous robotic functions, the
research improves task reliability and efficiency for space applications. The
key task addressed is the autonomous deployment of flexible solar panels using
an extendable ladder-like structure and a robotic manipulator with real-time
feedback for precision. The manipulator relays position and force-torque data,
enabling dynamic error detection and adaptive control during deployment. To
mitigate the effects of sinkage, variable payload, and low-lighting conditions,
efficient motion planning strategies are employed, supplemented by human
control that allows operators to intervene in ambiguous scenarios. Digital twin
simulation enhances system robustness by enabling continuous feedback,
iterative task refinement, and seamless integration with the deployment
pipeline. The system has been tested to validate its performance in simulated
lunar conditions and ensure reliability in extreme lighting, variable terrain,
changing payloads, and sensor limitations.

                                        <span>  Service robots are increasingly deployed in diverse and dynamic environments,
where both physical layouts and social contexts change over time and across
locations. In these unstructured settings, conventional navigation systems that
rely on fixed parameters often fail to generalize across scenarios, resulting
in degraded performance and reduced social acceptance. Although recent
approaches have leveraged reinforcement learning to enhance traditional
planners, these methods often fail in real-world deployments due to poor
generalization and limited simulation diversity, which hampers effective
sim-to-real transfer. To tackle these issues, we present LE-Nav, an
interpretable and scene-aware navigation framework that leverages multi-modal
large language model reasoning and conditional variational autoencoders to
adaptively tune planner hyperparameters. To achieve zero-shot scene
understanding, we utilize one-shot exemplars and chain-of-thought prompting
strategies. Additionally, a conditional variational autoencoder captures the
mapping between natural language instructions and navigation hyperparameters,
enabling expert-level tuning. Experiments show that LE-Nav can generate
hyperparameters achieving human-level tuning across diverse planners and
scenarios. Real-world navigation trials and a user study on a smart wheelchair
platform demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
quantitative metrics such as success rate, efficiency, safety, and comfort,
while receiving higher subjective scores for perceived safety and social
acceptance. Code is available at https://github.com/Cavendish518/LE-Nav.

demonstrations to reproduce demonstration-like logic-constrained behaviors.
Learning logic constraints is challenging due to the combinatorially large
space of possible specifications and the ill-posed nature of non-Markovian
constraints. To figure it out, we introduce a novel temporal-constraint
learning method, which we call inverse logic-constraint learning (ILCL). Our
method frames ICL as a two-player zero-sum game between 1) a genetic
algorithm-based temporal-logic mining (GA-TL-Mining) and 2) logic-constrained
reinforcement learning (Logic-CRL). GA-TL-Mining efficiently constructs syntax
trees for parameterized truncated linear temporal logic (TLTL) without
predefined templates. Subsequently, Logic-CRL finds a policy that maximizes
task rewards under the constructed TLTL constraints via a novel constraint
redistribution scheme. Our evaluations show ILCL outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines in learning and transferring TL constraints on four temporally
constrained tasks. We also demonstrate successful transfer to real-world
peg-in-shallow-hole tasks.

confined spaces where traditional sensors and preplanned paths cannot be
followed. Sensor noise and situational change can cause significant uncertainty
in environmental representation. Thus, this paper explores how to represent
mapping inconsistency in vision-based sensing and incorporate depth estimation
confidence into the mapping framework. The scene depth and the confidence are
estimated using the RAFT-Stereo model and are integrated into a voxel-based
mapping framework, Voxblox. Improvements in the existing Voxblox weight
calculation and update mechanism are also proposed. Finally, a qualitative
analysis of the proposed method is performed in a confined pool and in a pier
in the Trondheim fjord. Experiments using an underwater robot demonstrated the
change in uncertainty in the visualization.

                                        <span>  Merging onto a highway is a complex driving task that requires identifying a
safe gap, adjusting speed, often interactions to create a merging gap, and
completing the merge maneuver within a limited time window while maintaining
safety and driving comfort. In this paper, we introduce a Safe Merging and
Real-Time Merge (SMART-Merge) planner, a lattice-based motion planner designed
to facilitate safe and comfortable forced merging. By deliberately adapting
cost terms to the unique challenges of forced merging and introducing a desired
speed heuristic, SMART-Merge planner enables the ego vehicle to merge
successfully while minimizing the merge time. We verify the efficiency and
effectiveness of the proposed merge planner through high-fidelity CarMaker
simulations on hundreds of highway merge scenarios. Our proposed planner
achieves the success rate of 100% as well as completes the merge maneuver in
the shortest amount of time compared with the baselines, demonstrating our
planner's capability to handle complex forced merge tasks and provide a
reliable and robust solution for autonomous highway merge. The simulation

for contact-rich manipulation tasks that generalize spatially across task
configurations. We focus on achieving robust spatial generalization of the
policy for the peg-in-hole (PiH) task trained from a small number of
demonstrations. We propose EquiContact, a hierarchical policy composed of a
high-level vision planner (Diffusion Equivariant Descriptor Field, Diff-EDF)
and a novel low-level compliant visuomotor policy (Geometric Compliant ACT,
G-CompACT). G-CompACT operates using only localized observations (geometrically
consistent error vectors (GCEV), force-torque readings, and wrist-mounted RGB
images) and produces actions defined in the end-effector frame. Through these
design choices, we show that the entire EquiContact pipeline is
SE(3)-equivariant, from perception to force control. We also outline three key
components for spatially generalizable contact-rich policies: compliance,
localized policies, and induced equivariance. Real-world experiments on PiH
tasks demonstrate a near-perfect success rate and robust generalization to
unseen spatial configurations, validating the proposed framework and
principles. The experimental videos can be found on the project website:

                                        <span>  Scenario-based testing has emerged as a common method for autonomous vehicles
(AVs) safety assessment, offering a more efficient alternative to mile-based
testing by focusing on high-risk scenarios. However, fundamental questions
persist regarding its stopping rules, residual risk estimation, debug
effectiveness, and the impact of simulation fidelity on safety claims. This
paper argues that a rigorous statistical foundation is essential to address
these challenges and enable rigorous safety assurance. By drawing parallels
between AV testing and established software testing methods, we identify shared
research gaps and reusable solutions. We propose proof-of-concept models to
quantify the probability of failure per scenario (\textit{pfs}) and evaluate
testing effectiveness under varying conditions. Our analysis reveals that
neither scenario-based nor mile-based testing universally outperforms the
other. Furthermore, we give an example of formal reasoning about alignment of
synthetic and real-world testing outcomes, a first step towards supporting
statistically defensible simulation-based safety claims.

                                        <span>  Navigation in dynamic environments requires autonomous systems to reason
about uncertainties in the behavior of other agents. In this paper, we
introduce a unified framework that combines trajectory planning with multimodal
predictions and active probing to enhance decision-making under uncertainty. We
develop a novel risk metric that seamlessly integrates multimodal prediction
uncertainties through mixture models. When these uncertainties follow a
Gaussian mixture distribution, we prove that our risk metric admits a
closed-form solution, and is always finite, thus ensuring analytical
tractability. To reduce prediction ambiguity, we incorporate an active probing
mechanism that strategically selects actions to improve its estimates of
behavioral parameters of other agents, while simultaneously handling multimodal
uncertainties. We extensively evaluate our framework in autonomous navigation
scenarios using the MetaDrive simulation environment. Results demonstrate that
our active probing approach successfully navigates complex traffic scenarios
with uncertain predictions. Additionally, our framework shows robust
performance across diverse traffic agent behavior models, indicating its broad
applicability to real-world autonomous navigation challenges. Code and videos

                                        <span>  The deployment of autonomous agents in environments involving human
interaction has increasingly raised security concerns. Consequently,
understanding the circumstances behind an event becomes critical, requiring the
development of capabilities to justify their behaviors to non-expert users.
Such explanations are essential in enhancing trustworthiness and safety, acting
as a preventive measure against failures, errors, and misunderstandings.
Additionally, they contribute to improving communication, bridging the gap
between the agent and the user, thereby improving the effectiveness of their
interactions. This work presents an accountability and explainability
architecture implemented for ROS-based mobile robots. The proposed solution
consists of two main components. Firstly, a black box-like element to provide
accountability, featuring anti-tampering properties achieved through blockchain
technology. Secondly, a component in charge of generating natural language
explanations by harnessing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs)
over the data contained within the previously mentioned black box. The study
evaluates the performance of our solution in three different scenarios, each
involving autonomous agent navigation functionalities. This evaluation includes
a thorough examination of accountability and explainability metrics,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in using accountable data from
robot actions to obtain coherent, accurate and understandable explanations,
even when facing challenges inherent in the use of autonomous agents in
real-world scenarios.

settings must be able to not only reason about the steps needed to accomplish
their goals, but also process complex instructions, prompts, and even feedback
during task execution. Intricate instructions (e.g., "Could you make me a
vegetarian sandwich?" or "I don't like that one") require not just the ability
to physically perform the individual steps, but the ability to situate complex
commands and feedback in the physical world. In this work, we describe a system
that uses vision-language models in a hierarchical structure, first reasoning
over complex prompts and user feedback to deduce the most appropriate next step
to fulfill the task, and then performing that step with low-level actions. In
contrast to direct instruction following methods that can fulfill simple
commands ("pick up the cup"), our system can reason through complex prompts and
incorporate situated feedback during task execution ("that's not trash"). We
evaluate our system across three robotic platforms, including single-arm,
dual-arm, and dual-arm mobile robots, demonstrating its ability to handle tasks
such as cleaning messy tables, making sandwiches, and grocery shopping. Videos

reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks.
Our recipe is designed for the offline-to-online RL setting, where the goal is
to leverage an offline prior dataset to maximize the sample-efficiency of
online learning. Effective exploration and sample-efficient learning remain
central challenges in this setting, as it is not obvious how the offline data
should be utilized to acquire a good exploratory policy. Our key insight is
that action chunking, a technique popularized in imitation learning where
sequences of future actions are predicted rather than a single action at each
timestep, can be applied to temporal difference (TD)-based RL methods to
mitigate the exploration challenge. Q-chunking adopts action chunking by
directly running RL in a 'chunked' action space, enabling the agent to (1)
leverage temporally consistent behaviors from offline data for more effective
online exploration and (2) use unbiased $n$-step backups for more stable and
efficient TD learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Q-chunking
exhibits strong offline performance and online sample efficiency, outperforming
prior best offline-to-online methods on a range of long-horizon, sparse-reward
manipulation tasks.

intelligence at the forefront of robotics research. Embodied intelligence
focuses on agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting within the
physical world. Achieving robust embodied intelligence requires not only
advanced perception and control, but also the ability to ground abstract
cognition in real-world interactions. Two foundational technologies, physical
simulators and world models, have emerged as critical enablers in this quest.
Physical simulators provide controlled, high-fidelity environments for training
and evaluating robotic agents, allowing safe and efficient development of
complex behaviors. In contrast, world models empower robots with internal
representations of their surroundings, enabling predictive planning and
adaptive decision-making beyond direct sensory input. This survey
systematically reviews recent advances in learning embodied AI through the
integration of physical simulators and world models. We analyze their
complementary roles in enhancing autonomy, adaptability, and generalization in
intelligent robots, and discuss the interplay between external simulation and
internal modeling in bridging the gap between simulated training and real-world
deployment. By synthesizing current progress and identifying open challenges,
this survey aims to provide a comprehensive perspective on the path toward more
capable and generalizable embodied AI systems. We also maintain an active

                                        <span>  This paper presents FLAF, a focal line and feature-constrained active view
planning method for tracking failure avoidance in feature-based visual
navigation of mobile robots. Our FLAF-based visual navigation is built upon a
feature-based visual teach and repeat (VT\&R) framework, which supports many
robotic applications by teaching a robot to navigate on various paths that
cover a significant portion of daily autonomous navigation requirements.
However, tracking failure in feature-based visual simultaneous localization and
mapping (VSLAM) caused by textureless regions in human-made environments is
still limiting VT\&R to be adopted in the real world. To address this problem,
the proposed view planner is integrated into a feature-based visual SLAM system
to build up an active VT\&R system that avoids tracking failure. In our system,
a pan-tilt unit (PTU)-based active camera is mounted on the mobile robot. Using
FLAF, the active camera-based VSLAM operates during the teaching phase to
construct a complete path map and in the repeat phase to maintain stable
localization. FLAF orients the robot toward more map points to avoid mapping
failures during path learning and toward more feature-identifiable map points
beneficial for localization while following the learned trajectory. Experiments
in real scenarios demonstrate that FLAF outperforms the methods that do not
consider feature-identifiability, and our active VT\&R system performs well in
complex environments by effectively dealing with low-texture regions.

                                        <span>  Diffusion models exhibit impressive scalability in robotic task learning, yet
they struggle to adapt to novel, highly dynamic environments. This limitation
primarily stems from their constrained replanning ability: they either operate
at a low frequency due to a time-consuming iterative sampling process, or are
unable to adapt to unforeseen feedback in case of rapid replanning. To address
these challenges, we propose RA-DP, a novel diffusion policy framework with
training-free high-frequency replanning ability that solves the above
limitations in adapting to unforeseen dynamic environments. Specifically, our
method integrates guidance signals which are often easily obtained in the new
environment during the diffusion sampling process, and utilizes a novel action
queue mechanism to generate replanned actions at every denoising step without
retraining, thus forming a complete training-free framework for robot motion
adaptation in unseen environments. Extensive evaluations have been conducted in
both well-recognized simulation benchmarks and real robot tasks. Results show
that RA-DP outperforms the state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods in terms of
replanning frequency and success rate. Moreover, we show that our framework is
theoretically compatible with any training-free guidance signal.

approaches to learning from demonstrations, with a focus on the structure of
reward functions and their implications for policy learning. Feature-based
methods offer dense, interpretable rewards that excel at high-fidelity motion
imitation, yet often require sophisticated representations of references and
struggle with generalization in unstructured settings. GAN-based methods, in
contrast, use implicit, distributional supervision that enables scalability and
adaptation flexibility, but are prone to training instability and coarse reward
signals. Recent advancements in both paradigms converge on the importance of
structured motion representations, which enable smoother transitions,
controllable synthesis, and improved task integration. We argue that the
dichotomy between feature-based and GAN-based methods is increasingly nuanced:
rather than one paradigm dominating the other, the choice should be guided by
task-specific priorities such as fidelity, diversity, interpretability, and
adaptability. This work outlines the algorithmic trade-offs and design
considerations that underlie method selection, offering a framework for
principled decision-making in learning from demonstrations.

                                        <span>  This paper addresses a challenging interactive task learning scenario we call
rearrangement under unawareness: an agent must manipulate a rigid-body
environment without knowing a key concept necessary for solving the task and
must learn about it during deployment. For example, the user may ask to "put
the two granny smith apples inside the basket", but the agent cannot correctly
identify which objects in the environment are "granny smith" as the agent has
not been exposed to such a concept before. We introduce SECURE, an interactive
task learning policy designed to tackle such scenarios. The unique feature of
SECURE is its ability to enable agents to engage in semantic analysis when
processing embodied conversations and making decisions. Through embodied
conversation, a SECURE agent adjusts its deficient domain model by engaging in
dialogue to identify and learn about previously unforeseen possibilities. The
SECURE agent learns from the user's embodied corrective feedback when mistakes
are made and strategically engages in dialogue to uncover useful information
about novel concepts relevant to the task. These capabilities enable the SECURE
agent to generalize to new tasks with the acquired knowledge. We demonstrate in
the simulated Blocksworld and the real-world apple manipulation environments
that the SECURE agent, which solves such rearrangements under unawareness, is
more data-efficient than agents that do not engage in embodied conversation or
semantic analysis.

carries 3D spatial details. In this paper, a visual backbone based on the
vision transformer is proposed to fuse RGB and depth modalities for enhancing
generalization. Different modalities are first processed by separate CNN stems,
and the combined convolutional features are delivered to the scalable vision
transformer to obtain visual representations. Moreover, a contrastive
unsupervised learning scheme is designed with masked and unmasked tokens to
accelerate the sample efficiency during the reinforcement learning progress.
For sim2real transfer, a flexible curriculum learning schedule is developed to

                                        <span>  Controlling a robot based on physics-consistent dynamic models, such as Deep
Lagrangian Networks (DeLaN), can improve the generalizability and
interpretability of the resulting behavior. However, in complex environments,
the number of objects to potentially interact with is vast, and their physical
properties are often uncertain. This complexity makes it infeasible to employ a
single global model. Therefore, we need to resort to online system
identification of context-aware models that capture only the currently relevant
aspects of the environment. While physical principles such as the conservation
of energy may not hold across varying contexts, ensuring physical plausibility
for any individual context-aware model can still be highly desirable,
particularly when using it for receding horizon control methods such as model
predictive control (MPC). Hence, in this work, we extend DeLaN to make it
context-aware, combine it with a recurrent network for online system
identification, and integrate it with an MPC for adaptive, physics-consistent
control. We also combine DeLaN with a residual dynamics model to leverage the
fact that a nominal model of the robot is typically available. We evaluate our
method on a 7-DOF robot arm for trajectory tracking under varying loads. Our
method reduces the end-effector tracking error by 39%, compared to a 21%
improvement achieved by a baseline that uses an extended Kalman filter.

patterns or operate in an offline, non-interactive manner that fails to expose
rare, safety-critical corner cases. In this paper, we introduce an online,
retrieval-augmented large language model (LLM) framework for generating
safety-critical driving scenarios. Our method first employs an LLM-based
behavior analyzer to infer the most dangerous intent of the background vehicle
from the observed state, then queries additional LLM agents to synthesize
feasible adversarial trajectories. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting and
accelerate adaptation, we augment the framework with a dynamic memorization and
retrieval bank of intent-planner pairs, automatically expanding its behavioral
library when novel intents arise. Evaluations using the Waymo Open Motion
Dataset demonstrate that our model reduces the mean minimum time-to-collision
from 1.62 to 1.08 s and incurs a 75% collision rate, substantially
outperforming baselines.

scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a Multimodal-guided Virtual
Cues Projection (MVCP) scheme that generates virtual cues to enrich sparse

the generated virtual cues. Specifically, the MVCP scheme seamlessly integrates
RGB sensors into LiDAR-based systems, leveraging a set of 2D detections to
create dense 3D virtual cues that significantly improve the sparsity of point
clouds. These virtual cues can naturally integrate with existing LiDAR-based 3D
trackers, yielding substantial performance gains. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance on the NuScenes

resonance frequency to efficiently transmit and receive very-low-frequency
(VLF) electromagnetic signals underwater. We outline the design, simulation,
fabrication, and integration of the proposed system on low-power embedded
platforms focusing on portable and scalable applications. For performance
evaluation, we deployed BlueME on an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) and a
remotely operated vehicle (ROV) in open-water field trials. Our tests
demonstrate that BlueME maintains reliable signal transmission at distances
beyond 200 meters while consuming only 1 watt of power. Field trials show that
the system operates effectively in challenging underwater conditions such as
turbidity, obstacles, and multipath interference -- that generally affect
acoustics and optics. Our analysis also examines the impact of complete
submersion on system performance and identifies key deployment considerations.
This work represents the first practical underwater deployment of ME antennas
outside the laboratory, and implements the largest VLF ME array system to date.
BlueME demonstrates significant potential for marine robotics and automation in
multi-robot cooperative systems and remote sensor networks.

is a promising paradigm in reinforcement learning (RL), with applications to
sparse reward problems, open-ended exploration, and hierarchical skill design.
Recent works have made promising steps by exploiting the prior knowledge of
large language models (LLMs). However, these approaches suffer from important
limitations: they are either not scalable to problems requiring billions of
environment samples, due to requiring LLM annotations for each observation, or
they require a diverse offline dataset, which may not exist or be impossible to
collect. In this work, we address these limitations through a combination of
algorithmic and systems-level contributions. We propose ONI, a distributed
architecture that simultaneously learns an RL policy and an intrinsic reward
function using LLM feedback. Our approach annotates the agent's collected
experience via an asynchronous LLM server, which is then distilled into an
intrinsic reward model. We explore a range of algorithmic choices for reward
modeling with varying complexity, including hashing, classification, and
ranking models. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across a
range of challenging tasks from the NetHack Learning Environment, while
removing the need for large offline datasets required by prior work. We make

MPC Builder, which automatically generates MPCs on demand, based on symbolic
task commands generated by the LVLM, while ensuring optimality and safety. The
generated MPCs can strongly assist the execution or rejection of LVLM-driven
task switching by providing feedback on the feasibility of the given tasks and
generating task-switching-aware MPCs. Our approach provides a safe, flexible,
and adaptable control framework, bridging the gap between cutting-edge
foundation models and reliable vehicle operation. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach through a simulation experiment, showing that our
system can safely and effectively handle highway driving while maintaining the
flexibility and adaptability of LVLMs.

algorithms have proven to be crucial for their improvement over the years.
Nevertheless, the ultimate measure of effectiveness is their successful
transition from simulation to reality (sim2real). However, existing sim2real
transfer methods struggle to address the autonomy-oriented requirements of
balancing: (i) conditioned domain adaptation, (ii) robust performance with
limited examples, (iii) modularity in handling multiple domain representations,
and (iv) real-time performance. To alleviate these pain points, we present a
unified framework for learning cross-domain adaptive representations through
conditional latent diffusion for sim2real transferable autonomous driving
algorithms. Our framework offers options to leverage: (i) alternate foundation
models, (ii) a few-shot fine-tuning pipeline, and (iii) textual as well as
image prompts for mapping across given source and target domains. It is also
capable of generating diverse high-quality samples when diffusing across
parameter spaces such as times of day, weather conditions, seasons, and
operational design domains. We systematically analyze the presented framework
and report our findings in terms of performance benchmarks and ablation
studies, with critical quantitative metrics as well as insightful qualitative
examples and remarks. Additionally, we demonstrate the serviceability of
sim2real diffusion for autonomous driving using a behavioral cloning case
study. Our experiments indicate that the proposed framework is capable of
bridging the perceptual sim2real gap by over 40%, which highlights the
potential of diffusion models in sim2real transfer.
